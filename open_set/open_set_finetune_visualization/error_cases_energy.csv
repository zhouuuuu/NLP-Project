0,"I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom I had myself created. I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation. When it became <TIME>, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of <TIME>, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality. The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from <LOC>, and one from <PER> entreating me to join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in <LOC> desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to <LOC> might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at <LOC>, that we might proceed southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of <DATE>.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9845234155654907,0.9845234155654907,-0.624291181564331
1,"I should like to know why?” “Why, she got sopping wet in that brook <DATE>, and here, just as I knew it would be, she's got a fever.” “A fever, eh?” repeated Mr. <PER> in a startled tone. “Yes, sir, and what's more, when I told her you would send for the doctor, it was worse than about the rubbers. She talked all the rubbish you can think of. I'm sure she's flighty--said she never had a doctor, that she always got well, and even cried when I told her that that was nonsense.” “Was she ill <TIME>, do you think?” “I don't know. I found her trying to get up when I went to her room, and I saw at once that she wasn't able to. “Well, Mrs. <PER>, all I can do is to ask your pardon for adding so much to your cares. Let <PER> bring me my eggs, and then, if you please, telephone for Dr. <PER> to come over before his office hour.” “I will, sir, but I'll ask you to see the child before you go to town and make her promise to behave about the doctor. You'd have thought I was asking to let in a roaring lion.” “Shy, probably.” “Shy! That child shy!” thought Mrs. <PER>. “She knows Dr. <PER>,” continued the broker, “and if you had thought to mention him, she wouldn't have made any fuss.” “If you'll excuse me differing with you, Mr. <PER>, I don't think that child's got a shy bone in her body. In the trolley car <DATE>, didn't she make up to a perfect stranger! She eyed him and fingered that little gold pin she wears, till he smiled and touched <NUM> of the same pattern in his own cravat. Young as she is, she's some kind of a free mason or secret society, you may be sure. I actually saw him take her hand and give her the grip as he got out of the car. Why you know who it is, it was Mr. <PER> of Highland Street.” “H'm. You are imaginative, Mrs. <PER>. Mr. <PER> is fond of children, and <ORG> has a friendly way of looking at people.” The housekeeper bridled. “Well, all is, I guess, you'll find I ain't imaginative when you come to talk with her about the doctor,” was the firm response.",unknown,ArthurConanDoyle,0.7784321308135986,0.7784321308135986,-4.227915287017822
4,"That which is <NUM> to be noted in looking carefully at this draught of a new <ORG> which the plan of <ORG> includes,--that which the careful reader cannot fail to note, is the fact, that throughout all this most complete and radical exhibition of the subject (for brief and casual as that exhibition seems on the surface, the science and art from its root to its outermost branches, is there)--throughout all this exhibition, under all the superficial divisions and subdivisions of the subject, it is still the method of PROGRESSION which is set forth here: under all these divisions, there is still <NUM> point made; it is still the Art of a Tradition which is designed to reserve the _secrets_ of science, and the nobler arts of it, for the minds and ages that are able to receive them. This new art of tradition, with its new organs and methods, and its living and beautiful illustration, when once we look through the network of it to the unity within, this new rhetoric of science, is in fact the instrument which the philosopher would substitute, if he could, for those more cruel weapons which the men of his time were ready to take in hand; and it is the instrument with which he would forestall those yet more fearful political convulsions that already seemed to his eye to threaten from afar the social structures of Christendom; it is the beautiful and bloodless instrumentality whereby the mind of the world is to be wrenched insensibly from its old place without 'breaking all.' For neither does this author, any more than that other, who has been quoted here on this point, think it wise for the philosopher to rush madly out of his study with his <ORG>, and bawl to the <NUM> passer by in scientific terms the last result of his science, 'lording it over his ignorance' with what can be to him only a _magisterial_ announcement. For what else but that can it be, for instance, to tell the poor peasant, on his way to market, with his butter and eggs in his basket, planting his feet on the firm earth without any qualms or misgivings, and measuring his day by the sun's great toil and rejoicing race in heaven, what but this same magisterial teaching is it, to stop him, and tell him to his bewildered face that the sun never rises or sets, and that the earth is but a revolving ball?

7,"The water that poured plentifully from his cloak evinced that he had but just arrived at the <LOC>; but, whatever was his object, he seemed not to have attained it in meeting with the young men. He paused near the door, as if meditating whether to retire. ""My intrusion is altogether owing to a mistake, either of the landlord's or mine,"" he said. ""I came hither to seek another person; but, as I could not mention his name, my inquiries were rather vague."" ""I thank Heaven for the chance that sent you to us,"" replied <PER>, rousing himself. ""<PER> is wretched company; and a duller <TIME> have I never spent. We will renew our fire and our wine, and you must sit down with us.

I inquired of <PER> <TIME>."" <PER> did not express his doubts of the correctness of the information on which <PER> seemed to rely. Laying aside his cloak, he accepted his invitation to make one of the party, and sat down by the fireside. The aspect of the evening now gradually changed. A strange wild glee spread from one to another of the party, which, much to the surprise of his companions, began with and was communicated from, <PER>. He seemed to overflow with conceptions inimitably ludicrous, but so singular, that, till his hearers had imbibed a portion of his own spirit, they could only wonder at, instead of enjoying them. His applications to the wine were very unfrequent; yet his conversation was such as one might expect from a bottle of champagne endowed by a fairy with the gift of speech. The secret of this strange mirth lay in the troubled state of his spirits, which, like the vexed ocean at <TIME> (if the simile be not too magnificent), tossed forth a mysterious brightness. The undefined apprehensions that had drawn him to the inn still distracted his mind; but, mixed with them, there was a sort of joy not easily to be described. By degrees, and by the assistance of the wine, the inspiration spread, each <NUM> contributing such a quantity, and such quality of wit and whim, as was proportioned to his genius; but each one, and all, displaying a greater share of both than they had ever been suspected of possessing.

8,"He knew that there would come a time when all this tragic mirth--sporting with the edged tools of tyranny--playing around the edge of the great axe itself--would be indeed safe play; when his Fool could open his budget, and unroll his bitter jests--crushed together and infolded within themselves so long--and have a world to smile with him, and not the few who could unfold them only.

And so by means of that poetic order, which is the Providence of this piece, and that design which 'tunes the harmony of it,' it is a duke on whom that low correction, 'such as basest and most contemned wretches are punished with,' is exhibited, in spite of his indignant protest. _<PER>_.

I went home to dinner at Mr. <PER>’, and they welcomed me very kindly, and Mrs. <PER> kept my plate full all the time during dinner, so that I had no chance to empty it.

As soon as I got into the shirt I began to feel sort of warm and red about the face, which I found was owing to the reflection of the dyed wool upon my skin. After that, I took a pair of scissors and went to cutting my hair, which was very long.

20,"St. <PER> seems to state this in so many words when he says: ""But all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will."" Could our modern speculation, forced upon us by the facts, be more tersely stated? He has just enumerated the various gifts, and we find them very close to those of which we have experience.

Much virtue"" (or power) ""has gone out of me."" Then we come upon the working of miracles, which we should call the production of phenomena, and which would cover many different types, such as apports, where objects are brought from a distance, levitation of objects or of the human frame into the air, the production of lights and other wonders.

This mistake is repeated so often and so clearly that it is really not honest to ignore or deny it.

21,"Let's have a fire, and a feast, and a song,--or a psalm, or a prayer, as the case may be; only let it be _within_--no matter which it is': 'Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night,-- _My <PER> counsels_ well; come out o' the storm.' But here it is the houseless man, who is thinking of his kindred,--his royal family, for whom God has made him responsible, out in this same storm unbonneted; and in the tenderness of that sympathy, in the searching delicacy of that feeling with which he scrutinizes now their case, they seem to him less able than himself to resist its elemental '_tyranny_.' For in that ideal revolution--in that exact turn of the wheel of fortune--in that experimental 'change of places,' which the Poet recommends to those who occupy the upper ones in, the social structure, as a means of a more particular and practical acquaintance with the conditions of those for whom they legislate, new views of the common natural human relations; new views of the ends of social combinations are perpetually flashing on him; for it is the fallen monarch himself, the late owner and disposer of the Common Weal, it is this strangely _philosophic_, mysteriously philosophic, king--philosophic as that <PER> who was going to succeed him--it is the king who is chosen by the Poet as the chief commentator and expounder of that new political and social doctrine which the action of this play is itself suggesting.

My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. But I journey towards <LOC>, and I may there find consolation. I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend?

I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe. I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but <NUM> vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay. He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion. “That is also my victim!” he exclaimed.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9887726902961731,0.9887726902961731,-1.1290767192840576
24,"When, at last, through lapse of time or neglect of fresh cultivation, the power ran out, the empty formula may have been carried on, without either the blesser or the blessed understanding what it was that the hands of the bishop, and the force which streamed from them, were meant to bestow. The very words ""laying on of hands"" would seem to suggest something different from a mere benediction. Enough has been said, perhaps, to show the reader that it is possible to put forward a view of Christ's life which would be in strict accord with the most modern psychic knowledge, and which, far from supplanting Christianity, would show the surprising accuracy of some of the details handed down to us, and would support the novel conclusion that those very miracles, which have been the stumbling block to so many truthful, earnest minds, may finally offer some very cogent arguments for the truth of the whole narrative. Is this then a line of thought which merits the wholesale condemnations and anathemas hurled at it by those who profess to speak in the name of religion? At the same time, though we bring support to <ORG>, it would, indeed, be a misconception if these, or any such remarks, were quoted as sustaining its literal accuracy--an idea from which so much harm has come in the past. It would, indeed, be a good, though an unattainable thing, that a really honest and open-minded attempt should be made to weed out from that record the obvious forgeries and interpolations which disfigure it, and lessen the value of those parts which are really above suspicion. Is it necessary, for example, to be told, as an inspired fact from Christ's own lips, that <PER>, the son of <PER>, was struck dead within the precincts of the Temple in the time of Christ, when, by a curious chance, <LOC> has independently narrated the incident as having occurred during the siege of <LOC>, <DATE>? This makes it very clear that this particular <PER>, in its present form, was written after that event, and that the writer fitted into it <NUM> other incident which had struck his imagination.

So then mother and I prayed a great deal every day, and we knew father would be taken care of.

27,"That is the real original English doctrine of Art:--that is the doctrine of the age of <PER>, at least, as it stands in that queen's English, and though it may be very far from being orthodox at present, it is the doctrine which must determine the rule of any successful interpretation of works of art composed on that theory. 'And, therefore,' he proceeds to say, 'it was great injustice in <PER>, though springing out of a just hatred of the rhetoricians of his time, to esteem of rhetoric but as a voluptuary art, resembling it to cookery that did mar wholesome meats, and help unwholesome, by variety of sauces _to the pleasure of the taste_.' 'And therefore, as <PER> said eloquently, ""That virtue, if she could be seen, would move great love and affection, so, seeing that she cannot be showed to the sense by corporal shape, the next degree is to show her to the imagination _in lively representation_"": _for_ to show her to _reason only_, in _subtilty of argument_ was a thing ever derided in--_Chrysippus and many of the Stoics--who thought to thrust virtue upon men_ by _sharp disputations and conclusions, which have no sympathy with the will of man_.' 'Again, if the affections in themselves were pliant and obedient to reason, it were true there should be no great use of persuasions and injunctions to the will, more than of _naked propositions and proofs;_ but in regard of the continual mutinies and seditions of the affections, <PER> proboque <PER> sequor; 'Reason would become captive and servile, if eloquence of persuasions did not practise and win the imagination from the affections part, and contract a confederacy between the reason and the imagination, against the affections; for _the affections themselves_ carry ever an appetite to _good_, as reason doth. _The difference is_'--mark it--'the difference is, that the affection beholdeth merely _the present; reason_ beholdeth the future and _sum_ of time. And therefore the present _filling the imagination most_, reason is commonly vanquished; but after that force of eloquence and persuasion hath made things future and remote, _appear as present_, then, _upon the revolt of the imagination reason prevaileth_.' Not less important than that is this art in his scheme of learning. No wonder that the department of learning which he refers to the imagination should take that prime place in his grand division of it, and be preferred deliberately and on principle to the <NUM> others.

28,"By observation of species he seeks to ascend to the principles common to them. And he comes to us with a carefully prepared scheme of the 'elementary motions,'--outlined, and enriched with such observations as he and his school have been able to make under the disadvantages of that beginning. 'The motions of bodies,' he observes, 'are compounded, decomposed and combined, no less than the bodies themselves,' and he directs the attention of the student, who has his eye on practice, with great emphasis, to those instances which he calls 'instances of predominance,'--'instances which point out the predominance and submission of powers, compared' [not in abstract contemplation but in action,] 'compared with each other, and which,' [not in books but in <PER> is the more _energetic_ and _superior_, or more weak and inferior.'

A piece of leather, stretched _to a certain point_, does not break, and _so far_ the motion of continuity _predominates_' [for it is the question of predominance, and dominance, and domineering, and lordships, and liberties, of <NUM> kind and another, that he is handling]--'_so far_ the motion of continuity _predominates_ over that of tension; but if the tension be _greater_, the leather breaks, and the motion of continuity _yields_. _A certain quantity_ of water flows through a chink, and _so far_ the motion of greater congregation _predominates_ over that of continuity; but if the chink be _smaller, it yields_.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9800381064414978,0.9800381064414978,-0.6646826267242432

33,"I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion. <DATE> passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in <NUM> pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.

You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.” I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed. I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind.",unknown,JaneAusten,0.997515082359314,0.997515082359314,-1.92009699344635

40,"cries <ORG>, when he comes to the heath, with his torch, to seek out the king and his party; whereupon <PER>, thinking that an occasion has now arrived for defining his social outline, takes it upon him to answer, for his part-- 'Poor <PER>; that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the tadpole, the wall-newt, and the water-; that in the fury of his heart, when the _foul fiend rages_, swallows the old rat, and the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the standing pool; _who is whipped_ from _tything_ to _tything_' ; 'and stocked, punished, and imprisoned; who _hath had_ <NUM> suits to his back' '<NUM> shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear.' The Jesuits had been, then, recently and notoriously at work in <LOC>, endeavouring professedly to cast out '_the fiend_' from many possessed persons; and it appeared, to this great practical philosopher, that this creature he has fetched up here from the subterranean social abysses of his time, presented a very fitting subject for the operations of practitioners professing any miraculous or superior influence over the demons that infest human nature, or those that have power over human fortunes. He has brought him out here thus distinctly, for the purpose of inquiring whether there is any exorcism which can meet his case, or that of the great human multitude, that no man can number, of whose penury and vice he stands here as the elected, pre-eminent, royal representative. In that survey and report of human affairs, which this author felt himself called upon to make, the case of this poor creature had attracted his attention, and appeared to him to require looking to; and, accordingly, he has made a note of it. He is admirably seconded in his views on this subject, by the king himself, who, in that fine philosophic humour which his madness and his misery have served to develop in him, stands ready to lend himself to the boldest and most delicate philosophical inquiries. For the point to be noted here,--and it is one of no ordinary importance,--is, that this mad humour for philosophical investigation, which has seized so strangely the royal mind, does not appear to be at all in the vein of that old-fashioned philosophy, which had been rattling its abstractions in the face of the collective human misery for <DATE>.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9740758538246155,0.9740758538246155,-0.9500646591186523
44,"'If they be not tossed on the waves of _counsel_, they will be _tossed on the waves of fortune_.' That last 'tossing' requires a <NUM> cogitation. There might have been a more direct way of expressing it; but this author prefers similes in such cases, he tells us. But here is more on the same subject. 'It were good that men in their RENOVATIONS follow the example of time itself, which, indeed, innovateth greatly, but quietly, and by degrees scarce to be perceived;' and 'Discretion in speech is more than eloquence.' These are the sentiments and opinions of that man of science, whose works we are now opening, not caring under what particular name or form we may find them. <NUM> or <NUM> of these observations do not sound at all like prescience _now_; but at the time when they were given out as precepts of direction, it required that acquaintance with the nature of things in general which is derived from a large and studious observation of particulars, to put them into a form so oracular. But this general suggestion with regard to our books of moral philosophy, and their adaptation to the largest effect on the will and appetite under the given conditions of time--conditions which involve the instruction of masses of men, in whom _affection_ predominates-- men in whom judgment is not yet matured--men not attempered with the time and experience of ages, by means of those preservations of it which the traditions of learning make; beside this general suggestion in regard to these so potent instrumentalities in manners, he has another to make, one in which this general proposition to substitute learning for preconception in _practical <NUM> least, as far as may be, comes out again in the form of criticism, and of a most specially significant kind. It is a point which he touches lightly here; but one which he touches again and again in other parts of this work, and one which he resumes at large in his practical ethics. 'Again, is there not a caution likewise to be given of the doctrines of moralities themselves, some kinds of them, lest they make men too _precise, arrogant, incompatible_, as <LOC> saith of <ORG>, in _<PER>_: ""<PER> bona <PER> et <ORG> ipsius scitote esse <PER>: <ORG>, <NUM> sunt omnia non a natura, sed a magistro?""'",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9686301350593567,0.9686301350593567,-1.182330846786499
46,"For as the ancient politicians in popular estates were wont to compare the people to the sea, and the _orators_ to the winds, because the sea would of itself be calm and quiet, if the winds did not move and trouble it; _so_ the _people would be peaceable_ and _tractable_, if the _seditious orators did not set them in working and agitation_; so it may be fitly said, that the mind, in the nature thereof, would be _temperate_ and _stayed_, if _the affections_, as winds, did not put it into tumult and perturbation. And _here, again_, I find, _strange as before_, that _<PER>_ should have written divers volumes of _Ethics_, and never handled THE <ORG>, which is the _principal subject thereof_; and yet, in his _Rhetorics_, where they are considered but _collaterally_, and in a <NUM> degree, as they may be moved by speech, he <LOC> place for them, and handleth them well _for the quantity_, but where their _true place_ is, he _permitteth_ them. (Very much the method of procedure adopted by the philosopher who composes that criticism; who also finds a place for the affections in passing, where they are considered collaterally, and in a <NUM> degree, and for the quantity, he handleth them well, and who knows how to bring his <LOC> to bear on them, as well as the politicians in popular estates did of old, though for a different end; but where their true place is, he, too, _permitteth_ them; and, in his Novum Organum, he keeps so clear of them, and _permits_ them so fully, that the critics tell us he never meant it should touch them.) 'For it is not his disputations about pleasure and pain that can satisfy this inquiry, no more than he that should _generally_ handle the nature of light can be said to handle the nature of _colours_; for pleasure and pain are to the particular affections as light is to the particular colours.' Is not this a man for particulars, then? And when he comes to the practical doctrine,--to _the art_--to the knowledge, which is _power_,--will he not have particulars here, as well as in those other arts which are based on them? Will he not have particulars here, as well as in chemistry and natural philosophy, and botany and mineralogy; or, when it comes to practice here, will he be content, after all, with the old line of argument, and elegant disquisition, with the old generalities and subtleties of definition, which required no collection of particulars, which were independent of observation, or for which the popular accidental observation sufficed?",unknown,JaneAusten,0.9365076422691345,0.9365076422691345,-5.534961700439453
47,"But it is when he comes to speak of what he calls the _Illustration_ of it, that the convergency of his design begins to be laid open to us, for this work is not what it may seem on the surface, as he takes pains to intimate to us--a 'mere muster-roll of sciences.' It is when he comes to tell us that he will have his 'truth in beauty dyed,' that he does not propose to have the new learning left in the form of argument and logic, or in the form of bare scientific fact, that he does not mean to appeal with it to the _reason_ only; that he will have it in a form in which it will be able to attract and allure men, and make them in love with it, a form in which it will be able to force its way into the will and the affections, and make a lodgement in the hearts of men, long ere it is able to reach the judgment;--it is not till he begins to bring out here, his new doctrine of the true end of rhetoric, and the use to which it ought to be put in subordination to science, that we begin to perceive the significance of the arrangement which brings this theory of <ORG> into immediate connection with the new science of human nature and human life which the Author is about to constitute,--so as to serve as an introduction to it--the arrangement which interposes this art of Tradition, between the New Logic and its application to <ORG>--to POLICY and MORALITY. He will not consent to have this so _powerful_ engine of popular influence, which the æsthetic art seems, to his eye, to offer, left out, in his scheme of scientific instrumentalities: he will not pass it by scornfully, as some other philosophers have done, treating it merely as a voluptuary art. He will have of it, something which shall differ, not in degree only, but in kind, from the art of the confectioner. He begins by stating frankly his reasons for making so much of it in this grave treatise, which is what it professes to be, a treatise on <ORG> and its <ORG>.

51,"We have them, _our_ Interpreters, _our_ Poets, _our_ Reformers, who start from the actualities--from the actualities of nature in general, and of the human nature in particular--who make the most careful study of man as he is, in themselves and in all men, the basis of their innovation, the beginning of their advancement to the ideal or divine.

The inner history of this time is indeed still wanting to us; and the reason is, that we have not yet applied to the reading of its principal documents that key of times which our contemporary historians have already put into our hands--that key which, we are told on good authority, is, in certain cases, indispensable to the true interpretation. That the direct contemporary testimony on which history depends is, in this case, vitiated, tainted at its source, and through all its details--that the documents are all of them, on the face of them, 'suspicious,' and not fit to be received as historical evidence without the severest scrutiny and re-examination--this is the fact which remains to be taken into the account here.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9785324335098267,0.9785324335098267,-0.7518213391304016

Her companion did not reply at once, and <PER> lazily turned her head to where she could view the eyes fixed upon her. “What are you thinking of, <PER>?” “I was just thinking that if my mother made you a thin green dress that swept around you all long and narrow, you'd look like a flower, too.” The girl smiled back at the sky. “That's very nice. You can think those thoughts all you please.” “That wasn't all, though, because I was thinking about Dr. <PER>. He feels sorry. I couldn't tell you about it at lunch, because aunt <ORG>--well, because--” “Yes,” returned <PER> quietly. “It is better for us to be alone.” <ORG>'s brow relaxed. “Yes,” she said contentedly, “in the Ravine of Happiness.” “Look out, though,” continued the girl in the same quiet tone and looking back at the sky. “Look out what you say here.

61,"In these gorgeous vapors, <PER>'s fancy, in the interval of other thoughts, pictured a fairy-land, and longed for wings to visit it. But as the clouds lost their brilliancy, and assumed <NUM> a dull purple, and then a sullen gray tint, <PER>'s thoughts recurred to the adventure of the angler, which her imagination was inclined to invest with an undue singularity. It was, however, sufficiently unaccountable that an entire stranger should venture to demand of her a private audience; and she assigned, in turn, <NUM> motives for such a request, none of which were in any degree satisfactory. Her most prevailing thought, though she could not justify it to her reason, inclined her to believe that the angler was a messenger from her father. But wherefore he should deem it necessary to communicate any intelligence that he might possess only by means of a private interview, and without the knowledge of her friends, was a mystery she could not solve. In this view of the matter, however, she half regretted that her instinctive delicacy had impelled her so suddenly to break off their conference, admitting, in the secrecy of her own mind, that, if an opportunity were again to occur, it might not again be shunned. As if that unuttered thought had power to conjure up its object, she now became aware of a form standing in the garden, at a short distance from the window where she sat. The dusk had deepened, during <PER>'s abstraction, to such a degree, that the man's features were not perfectly distinguishable; but the maiden was not long in doubt of his identity, for he approached, and spoke in the same low tone in which he had addressed her when they stood by the stream. ""Do you still refuse my request, when its object is but your own good, and that of one who should be most dear to you?"" he asked. <PER>'s <NUM> impulse had been to cry out for assistance; her <NUM> was to fly: but, rejecting both these measures, she determined to remain, endeavoring to persuade herself that she was safe. The quivering of her voice, however, when she attempted to reply, betrayed her apprehensions. ""I cannot listen to such a request from a stranger,"" she said. ""If you bring news from--from my father, why is it not told to Dr. <PER>?"" ""Because what I have to say is for your ear alone,"" was the reply; ""and if you would avoid misfortune now, and sorrow hereafter, you will not refuse to hear me.""",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9836698770523071,0.9836698770523071,-1.0582265853881836

Oh, I see, you've spread them out very nicely; but those shoes--I shall have to have them cleaned and polished for you. Now go to sleep as quick as you can and have <TIME>'s rest. I'm sure the next time you go out you won't be so careless.” <ORG>'s eyes followed the speaker as she bustled about and at last took up the tray. “Will you kiss me good-night, Mrs. <PER>?” asked the child. The surprised housekeeper set down her burden, stooped over the bed and kissed her. “There now, I see you're sorry,” she said, somewhat touched. <PER> gave her a little smile. “No'm, I've stopped being sorry,” she replied. “She'd puzzle a <LOC> lawyer,” soliloquized the housekeeper as she descended the stairs with the tray. “I suppose her mother is uneducated and uses queer English. As the old ones croak, the young ones learn. The child uses words nobody ever heard of, and is ignorant of the commonest ones.

Each time there was a sound he glanced up, bracing himself for the approach of light feet, beaming face, and an ardent embrace. His interest in the news gradually lessened, and his expectancy increased. She did not come. At last he began to suspect that the unprecedented had happened, and that Mrs. <PER> herself was late. He looked at his watch with suddenly rising amazement. It was <TIME> past the appointed time. He began feeling around with his foot for the electric bell. It was an unaccustomed movement, for his wishes were usually anticipated. By the time he found it, he had become a seriously injured man, and the peal he rang summoned <PER> suddenly. “Bring me my coffee at once, if you please. What is the matter?” The maid did not know. He was drinking his <NUM> cup when the housekeeper entered the room, flushed of countenance. “You'll have to excuse me, Mr. <PER>. I couldn't come <TIME> sooner.

64,"<PER> took up the <NUM> swords that were their only luggage; the swords that, after <NUM> duels, they were now to surrender at last. MacIan, the blood thundering in his brain at the thought of that instant of farewell, bent over, fumbled at the handle and flung open the door to get out. But he did not get out. He did not get out, because it is dangerous to jump out of a car when it is going at full speed. And the car was going at full speed, because the young lady, without turning her head or so much as saying a syllable, had driven down a handle that made the machine plunge forward like a buffalo and then fly over the landscape like a greyhound. The police made <NUM> rush to follow, and then dropped so grotesque and hopeless a chase. Away in the vanishing distance they could see the sergeant furiously making notes. The open door, still left loose on its hinges, swung and banged quite crazily as they went whizzing up <NUM> road and down another. Nor did MacIan sit down; he stood up stunned and yet staring, as he would have stood up at the trumpet of <DATE>. A black dot in the distance sprang up a tall black forest, swallowed them and spat them out again at the other end. A railway bridge grew larger and larger till it leapt upon their backs bellowing, and was in its turn left behind. Avenues of poplars on both sides of the road chased each other like the figures in a zoetrope. Now and then with a shock and rattle they went through sleeping moonlit villages, which must have stirred an instant in their sleep as at the passing of a fugitive earthquake. Sometimes in an outlying house a light in <NUM> erratic, unexpected window would give them a nameless hint of the <NUM> human secrets which they left behind them with their dust. Sometimes even a slouching rustic would be afoot on the road and would look after them, as after a flying phantom. But still <ORG> stood up staring at earth and heaven; and still the door he had flung open flapped loose like a flag. <PER>, after <TIME> of dumb amazement, had yielded to the healthiest element in his nature and gone off into uncontrollable fits of laughter. The girl had not stirred an inch. After another half mile that seemed a mere flash, <PER> leant over and locked the door. <PER> staggered at last into his seat and hid his throbbing head in his hands; and still the car flew on and its driver sat inflexible and silent.",Chesterton,VirginiaWoolf,0.9475580453872681,0.9475580453872681,-3.6782710552215576
65,"The shape of their old friend the constable had appeared against the pearl and pink of the sunrise. Somehow, it always looked a very funny shape when seen against the sunrise. * * * A wash of weary daylight was breaking over the country-side, and the fields and roads were full of white mist--the kind of white mist that clings in corners like cotton wool. The empty road, along which the chase had taken its turn, was overshadowed on <NUM> side by a very high discoloured wall, stained, and <PER>, as with seaweed--evidently the high-shouldered sentinel of some great gentleman's estate. A yard or <NUM> from the wall ran parallel to it a linked and tangled line of lime-trees, forming a kind of cloister along the side of the road. It was under this branching colonnade that the <NUM> fugitives fled, almost concealed from their pursuers by the twilight, the mist and the leaping zoetrope of shadows. Their feet, though beating the ground furiously, made but a faint noise; for they had kicked away their boots in the wood; their long, antiquated weapons made no jingle or clatter, for they had strapped them across their backs like guitars. They had all the advantages that invisibility and silence can add to speed. <NUM> behind them down the centre of the empty road the <NUM> of their pursuers came pounding and panting--a fat but powerful policeman who had distanced all the rest. He came on at a splendid pace for so portly a figure; but, like all heavy bodies in motion, he gave the impression that it would be easier for him to increase his pace than to slacken it suddenly. Nothing short of a brick wall could have abruptly brought him up. <PER> turned his head slightly and found breath to say something to <ORG>. MacIan nodded. Pursuer and pursued were fixed in their distance as they fled, for <NUM> of a mile, when they came to a place where <NUM> of the trees grew twistedly together, making a special obscurity. Past this place the pursuing policeman went thundering without thought or hesitation. But he was pursuing his shadow or the wind; for <PER> had put one foot in a crack of the tree and gone up it as quickly and softly as a cat. Somewhat more laboriously but in equal silence the long legs of the <ORG> had followed; and crouching in crucial silence in the cloud of leaves, they saw the whole posse of their pursuers go by and die into the dust and mists of the distance.",Chesterton,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9947964549064636,0.9947964549064636,-0.8700737357139587
67,"But <PER> being of a more active and birdlike type of mind did throw a glance round the scene. The consequence of which was that he nearly fell off the rock. On <NUM> sides of this shelly and sandy islet the sea stretched blue and infinite without a speck of land or sail; the same as <PER> had <NUM> seen it, except that the tide being out it showed a few yards more of slanting sand under the roots of the rocks. But on the <NUM> side the island exhibited a more extraordinary feature. In fact, it exhibited the extraordinary feature of not being an island at all. A long, curving neck of sand, as smooth and wet as the neck of the sea serpent, ran out into the sea and joined their rock to a line of low, billowing, and glistening sand-hills, which the sinking sea had just bared to the sun. Whether they were firm sand or quicksand it was difficult to guess; but there was at least no doubt that they lay on the edge of some larger land; for colourless hills appeared faintly behind them and no sea could be seen beyond. “Sakes alive!” cried <PER>, with rolling eyes; “this ain't an island in the <LOC>. We've butted the <ORG>.” MacIan turned his head, and his face, already pale, grew a shade paler. He was by this time walking in a world of omens and hieroglyphics, and he could not read anything but what was baffling or menacing in this brown gigantic arm of the earth stretched out into the sea to seize him. “MacIan,” said <PER>, in his temperate way, “whatever our eternal interrupted tete-a-tetes have taught us or not taught us, at least we need not fear the charge of fear. If it is essential to your emotions, I will cheerfully finish the fight here and now; but I must confess that if you kill me here I shall die with my curiosity highly excited and unsatisfied upon a minor point of geography.” “I do not want to stop now,” said the other, in his elephantine simplicity, “but we must stop for a moment, because it is a sign--perhaps it is a miracle.",Chesterton,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9953685998916626,0.9953685998916626,-1.118980884552002
69,"Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus! Chapter 1 I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for <DATE> counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger <DATE> perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family. As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. <NUM> of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was <LOC>, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of <ORG>, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved <LOC> with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance. <LOC> had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was <DATE> before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the <PER>. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. <LOC> had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for <DATE>, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at <DATE> he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion. His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support.",unknown,JaneAusten,0.99695885181427,0.99695885181427,-1.9820077419281006
74,"<PER> did not, however, remain long in this opinion; for when she reperused the letter, and considered the firm, regular characters, and the style,--calm and cold, even in requesting such a sacrifice,--she felt that there was nothing like insanity here. In fine, she came gradually to the belief that there were strong reasons, though incomprehensible by her, for the secrecy that her father had enjoined. Having arrived at this conviction, her decision lay plain before her. Her affection for Mr. <PER> was not, <ORG> was it possible,--so strong as that she would have felt for a parent who had watched over her from her infancy. Neither was the conception she had unavoidably formed of his character such as to promise that in him she would find an equivalent for all she must sacrifice. On the contrary, her gentle nature and loving heart, which otherwise would have rejoiced in a new object of affection, now shrank with something like dread from the idea of meeting her father,--stately, cold, and stern as she could not but imagine him. A sense of duty was therefore <PER>'s only support in resolving to tread the dark path that lay before her. Had there been any person of her own sex in whom <PER> felt confidence, there is little doubt that she would so far have disobeyed her father's letter as to communicate its contents, and take counsel as to her proceedings. But Mrs. <PER> was the only female--excepting, indeed, the maid-servant--to whom it was possible to make the communication; and, though <PER> at <NUM> thought of such a step, her timidity, and her knowledge of the lady's character, did not permit her to venture upon it. She next reviewed her acquaintances of the other sex; and Dr. <PER> <NUM> presented himself, as in every respect but one, an unexceptionable confidant. But the single exception was equivalent to many. The maiden, with the highest opinion of the doctor's learning and talents, had sufficient penetration to know, that, in the ways of the world, she was herself the better skilled of the <NUM>. For a moment she thought of <PER>; but he was light and wild, and, which her delicacy made an insurmountable objection, there was an untold love between them. Her thoughts finally centred on <PER>. In his judgment, young and inexperienced though he was, she would have placed a firm trust; and his zeal, from whatever cause it arose, she could not doubt.",unknown,JaneAusten,0.9988744854927063,0.9988744854927063,-0.8985365033149719
76,"If, in the short time allowed her for reflection, an opportunity had occurred for consulting him, she would, in all probability, have taken advantage of it. But the terms on which they had parted <TIME> had afforded him no reason to hope for her confidence; and he felt that there were others who had a better right to it than himself. He did not, therefore, throw himself in her way; and poor <PER> was consequently left without an adviser. The determination that resulted from her own unassisted wisdom has been seen. When discovered by Dr. <PER> at <ORG> <LOC>, she was wholly prepared for flight, and, but for the intervention of the storm, would, ere then, have been far away. The firmness of resolve that had impelled a timid maiden upon such a step was not likely to be broken by <NUM> defeat; and <PER>, accordingly, confident that the stranger would make a <NUM> attempt, determined that no effort on her part should be wanting to its success. On reaching her chamber, therefore, instead of retiring to rest (of which, from her sleepless thoughts of <TIME>, she stood greatly in need), she sat watching for the abatement of the storm. Her meditations were now calmer than at any time since her <NUM> meeting with the angler. She felt as if her fate was decided. The stain had fallen upon her reputation: she was no longer the same pure being in the opinion of those whose approbation she most valued. <NUM> obstacle to her flight--and, to a woman's mind, a most powerful one--had thus been removed. Dark and intricate as was the way, it was easier now to proceed than to pause; and her desperate and forlorn situation gave her a strength which hitherto she had not felt. At every cessation in the torrent of rain that beat against the house, <PER> flew to the window, expecting to see the stranger form beneath it. But the clouds would again thicken, and the storm recommence with its former violence; and she began to fear that the approach of morning would compel her to meet the now dreaded face of Dr. <PER>. At length, however, a strong and steady wind, supplying the place of the fitful gusts of the preceding part of the night, broke and scattered the clouds from the broad expanse of the sky.

93,"I think you might have told me, so I could change these light trousers.” “Grandpa!” exclaimed <ORG> in a hushed tone, pointing before her. “See that horse--just like the coal black steed the princess rides in a fairy story.” “Why, that's so. He is a beauty. Where do you suppose the princess is?” “She's probably gone down the ravine,” returned the child, her feet drawn forward as if by a magnet. “Let's not go down yet.” The broker allowed himself to be led close to the pony, who turned his full bright eyes upon the pair curiously. “Do you think I might touch him, grandpa?” asked the child, still in the hushed voice. “If he's a fairy horse he might vanish,” returned Mr. <PER>. “Let's see how he stands it.” So saying he gave the shining flank some sturdy love pats. “Oh, he's all right. He's good substantial flesh and blood.” “But the lady,” said <PER>, looking about, the pupils of her eyes dilated with excitement. “Oh, I don't think a very big lady has been riding in that saddle. You can do as you'd be done by, I fancy.” Upon this <PER> stroked the pony over and over lovingly, and he nosed about her in a friendly way. “<PER>, see him, see him! And oh grandpa, see his beautiful star, white as a snowflake!” “Well, upon my word, if this isn't lucky,” remarked Mr. <PER>. “Here is some sugar in my pocket, now.” He passed some lumps to the child. “Would it be right?” she asked, glancing down the ravine. “Had I better wait till the girl comes up?” “She won't mind, I'll wager,” returned Mr. <PER>; so the child, thus encouraged, <ORG> the coal black steed, who, for all his poetical appearance, had evidently a strongly developed sweet tooth. “Hello, what's this!” exclaimed the broker, stepping to the fence and taking up something black and folded.

98,"The demonstration will be found complete on that ground; and on that ground alone the author is willing, and deliberately prefers, for the present, to rest it. 'External evidence, of course, will not be wanting; there will be enough and to spare, if the demonstration here be correct. But the author of the discovery was not willing to rob the world of this great question; but wished rather to share with it the benefit which the true solution of the Problem offers--the solution prescribed by those who propounded it to the future. It seemed better to save to the world the power and beauty of this demonstration, its intellectual stimulus, its demand on the judgment. It seemed better, that the world should acquire it also in the form of criticism, instead of being stupified and overpowered with the mere force of an irresistible, external, historical proof. Persons incapable of appreciating any other kind of proof,--those who are capable of nothing that does not 'directly fall under and strike _the senses_' as Lord Bacon expresses <ORG> have their time also; but it was proposed to present the subject <NUM> to minds of another order.' In the present volume, accordingly, the author applies herself to the demonstration and development of a system of philosophy, which has presented itself to her as underlying the superficial and ostensible text of <ORG>'s plays. Traces of the same philosophy, too, she conceives herself to have found in the acknowledged works of <PER>, and in those of other writers contemporary with him. All agree in <NUM> system; all these traces indicate a common understanding and unity of purpose in men among whom no brotherhood has hitherto been suspected, except as representatives of a grand and brilliant age, when the human intellect made a marked step in advance. The author did not (as her own consciousness assures her) either construct or originally seek this new philosophy. In many respects, if I have rightly understood her, it was at variance with her pre-conceived opinions, whether ethical, religious, or political. She had been for <DATE> a student of Shakspere, looking for nothing in his plays beyond what the world has agreed to find in them, when she began to see, under the surface, the gleam of this hidden treasure. It was carefully hidden, indeed, yet not less carefully indicated, as with a pointed finger, by such marks and references as could not ultimately escape the notice of a subsequent age, which should be capable of profiting by the rich inheritance.

99,"It was therefore with legitimate excitement that <TIME> after daybreak they saw that distinct shape of a solitary island standing up against the encircling strip of silver which ran round the skyline and separated the grey and green of the billows from the grey and mauve of the morning clouds. “What can it be?” cried <ORG>, in a dry-throated excitement. “I didn't know there were any <LOC> islands so far beyond the Scillies--Good Lord, it can't be Madeira, yet?” “I thought you were fond of legends and lies and fables,” said <PER>, grimly. “Perhaps it's Atlantis.” “Of course, it might be,” answered the other, quite innocently and gravely; “but I never thought the story about Atlantis was very solidly established.” “Whatever it is, we are running on to it,” said <PER>, equably, “and we shall be shipwrecked twice, at any rate.” The naked-looking nose of land projecting from the unknown island was, indeed, growing larger and larger, like the trunk of some terrible and advancing elephant. There seemed to be nothing in particular, at least on this side of the island, except shoals of shellfish lying so thick as almost to make it look like <NUM> of those toy grottos that the children make. In <NUM> place, however, the coast offered a soft, smooth bay of sand, and even the rudimentary ingenuity of the <NUM> amateur mariners managed to run up the little ship with her prow well on shore and her bowsprit pointing upward, as in a sort of idiotic triumph. They tumbled on shore and began to unload the vessel, setting the stores out in rows upon the sand with something of the solemnity of boys playing at pirates. There were Mr. <PER>'s cigar-boxes and Mr. <PER>'s <NUM> of champagne and Mr. <PER>'s tinned salmon and Mr. <PER>'s tinned tongue and Mr. <PER>'s tinned sardines, and every sort of preserved thing that could be seen at the <ORG> and <ORG> stores. Then <ORG> stopped with a jar of pickles in his hand and said abruptly: “I don't know why we're doing all this; I suppose we ought really to fall to and get it over.” Then he added more thoughtfully: “Of course this island seems rather bare and the survivor----” “The question is,” said <PER>, with cheerful speculation, “whether the survivor will be in a proper frame of mind for potted prawns.” MacIan looked down at the rows of tins and bottles, and the cloud of doubt still lowered upon his face.",Chesterton,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9946172833442688,0.9946172833442688,-1.1951017379760742
102,"The man with the moustaches was Cumberland Vane, the <LOC> police magistrate before whom he and <ORG> had once stood on their trial.

As a magistrate Mr. <PER> had been somewhat careless and shallow, but certainly kindly, and not inaccessible to common sense so long as it was put to him in strictly conventional language. He was at least an authority of a more human and refreshing sort than the crank with the wagging beard or the fiend with the forked chin. He went straight up to the magistrate, and said: “Good <TIME>, Mr. <PER>; I doubt if you remember me.” Cumberland Vane screwed the eye-glass into his scowling face for an instant, and then said curtly but not uncivilly: “Yes, I remember you, sir; assault or battery, wasn't it?--a fellow broke your window.

Whether you are visiting and inspecting the place, or attached to it as some kind of permanent legal adviser, your opinion must still----” <LOC> exploded with a detonation of oaths; his face was transfigured with fury and contempt, and yet in some odd way he did not seem specially angry with <PER>. “But Lord bless us and save us!” he gasped, at length; “I'm not here as an official at all.

I wore an epaulet then; we had the same state-room, you know, sir. I’m your old chum, <LOC>, sir,” and he again touched his cap. “I remember an _officer_ by that name,” said the <NUM> Lieutenant, emphatically, “and I know _you_, fellow.

The allusion to the poet <PER> in a previous chapter, leads me to speak of our mutual friends, <PER> and <PER>, who, with <PER> himself, <PER>, and my comrades of the main-top, comprised almost the only persons with whom I unreservedly consorted while on board the frigate. For I had not been long on board ere I found that it would not do to be intimate with everybody. An indiscriminate intimacy with all hands leads to sundry annoyances and scrapes, too often ending with a dozen at the gang-way. Though I was above a year in the frigate, there were scores of men who to the last remained perfect strangers to me, whose very names I did not know, and whom I would hardly be able to recognise now should I happen to meet them in the streets. In the dog-watches at sea, during the early part of the evening, the main-deck is generally filled with crowds of pedestrians, promenading up and down past the guns, like people taking the air in Broadway. At such times, it is curious to see the men nodding to each other’s recognitions (they might not have seen each other for <DATE>); exchanging a pleasant word with a friend; making a hurried appointment to meet him somewhere aloft on the <DATE>, or passing group after group without deigning the slightest salutation. Indeed, I was not at all singular in having but comparatively few acquaintances on board, though certainly carrying my fastidiousness to an unusual extent. My friend <PER> was a somewhat remarkable character; and if mystery includes romance, he certainly was a very romantic one. Before seeking an introduction to him through <PER>, I had often marked his tall, spare, upright figure stalking like <PER> among the pigmies of the <LOC>, to which he belonged. At first I found him exceedingly reserved and taciturn; his saturnine brow wore a scowl; he was almost repelling in his demeanour. In a word, he seemed desirous of hinting, that his list of man-of war friends was already made up, complete, and full; and there was no room for more.",HermanMelville,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9856528043746948,0.9856528043746948,-0.42585963010787964
113,"'Shut up your doors, (says <PER>), 'Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night. _My_ REGAN COUNSELS _well_; COME OUT O' THE STORM.' And it is because this representation is artistic and dramatic, and not simply historical, and the Poet must seek to condense, and sum and exhibit in dramatic appreciable figures, the unreckonable, undefinable historical suffering of <DATE>, aad lifetimes of this vain human struggle,--because, too, the wildest threats which nature in her terrors makes to man, had to be incorporated in this great philosophic piece; and because, lastly, the Poet would have the madness of the human will and passion, presented in its true scientific relations, that this storm collects into itself such ideal sublimities, and borrows from the human passion so many images of cruelty. In all the mad anguish of that ruined greatness, and wronged natural affection, the Poet, relentless as fortune herself in her sternest moods, intent on his experiment only, will bring out his great victim, and consign him to the wind and the rain, and the lightning, and the thunder, and bid his _senses_ undergo _their_ 'horrible pleasure.' For the senses, scorned as they had been in philosophy hitherto, the senses in this philosophy, have _their_ report also,--their full, honest report, to make to us. And the design of this piece, as already stated in the general, required in its execution, not only that these <NUM> kinds of suffering, these <NUM> grand departments of human need, should be included and distinguished in it, but that they should be brought together in this <NUM> man's experience, so that a deliberate comparison can be instituted between them; and the Poet will bid the philosophic king, the living 'subject' himself, report the experiment, and tell us plainly, once for all, whether the science of the physical Arts only, is the science which is wanting to man; or whether arts--scientific arts--that take hold of the moral nature, also, and deal with that not less effectively, can be dispensed with; whether, indeed, man is in any condition to dispense with _the_ Science and _the_ Art which puts him into intelligent and harmonious relations with nature in general. It was necessary to the purpose of the play to exhibit man's dependence on art, by means of his senses _and_ his sensibilities, and his intellectual conditions, and all his frailties and liabilities,-- his dependence on art, based on the knowledge of natural laws, universal laws,--constitutions, which _include_ the human.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9837692379951477,0.9837692379951477,-0.446524053812027
115,"On the part of the sailors, no surprise was shown that our captain did not send off a boat to the wreck; but the steerage passengers were indignant at what they called his barbarity. For me, I could not but feel amazed and shocked at his indifference; but my subsequent sea experiences have shown me, that such conduct as this is very common, though not, of course, when human life can be saved. So away we sailed, and left her; drifting, drifting on; a garden spot for barnacles, and a playhouse for the sharks. “Look there,” said <PER>, hanging over the rail and coughing—“look there; that’s a sailor’s coffin. Ha! ha! Buttons,” turning round to me—“how do you like that, Buttons? Wouldn’t you like to take a sail with them ’ere dead men? Wouldn’t it be nice?” And then he tried to laugh, but only coughed again. “Don’t laugh at dem poor fellows,” said <PER>, looking grave; “do’ you see <LOC>, <LOC> souls are farder off <PER> of Dood Hope.” “<PER>, <PER>,” shrieked <PER>, with a horrid grin, mimicking the <LOC>, “dare is no dood hope for dem, old boy; dey are drowned and d .... d, as you and I will be, <PER>, <NUM> of <LOC>.” “No, no,” said <PER>, “all sailors are saved; they have plenty of squalls here below, but fair weather aloft.” “And did you get that out of your silly Dream Book, you Greek?” howled <PER> through a cough. “Don’t talk of heaven to me—it’s a lie—I know it—and they are all fools that believe in it. Do you think, you Greek, that there’s any heaven for _you?_ Will they let _you_ in there, with that tarry hand, and that oily head of hair?

120,"So long as any yet extant national sentiment, or prejudice, was not yet directly assailed--so long as that arbitrary power was yet wise, or fortunate enough to withhold the blow which should make the individual sense of outrage, or the feeling of a class the common one--so long as those peaceful, social elements, yet waited the spark that was wanting to unite them--so long 'the laws of <LOC>' might be, indeed, at a <PER>'s or a Nym's or a <ORG>'s 'commandment,' for the Poet has but put into 'honest <PER>'s' mouth, a boast that worse men than he, made good in his time--so long, the faith, the lives, the liberties, the dearest earthly hopes, of <LOC>'s proudest subjects, her noblest, her bravest, her best, her most learned, her most accomplished, her most inspired, might be at the mercy of a woman's caprices, or the sport of a fool's sheer will and obstinacy, or conditioned on some low-lived 'favorites' whims. _So long_: And how long was that?--who does not know how long it was?--that was long enough for the whole <LOC> Age to happen in. In the reign of <PER>, and in the reign of her successor, and longer still, that was the condition of it--till its last act was finished--till its last word was spoken and penned--till its last mute sign was made--till all its celestial inspiration had returned to the God who gave it--till all its <ORG> clay was cold again. This was the combination of conditions of which <ORG> was the result. <ORG>, the organisers and chiefs of the modern civilization were the result of it. These were men in whom the genius of the <LOC> in its happiest union of developments, under its choicest and most favourable conditions of culture, in its yet fresh, untamed, unbroken, northern vigour, was at last subjected to the stimulus and provocation which the ancient learning brings with it to the northern mind--to the now unimaginable stimulus which, the revival of the ancient art and learning brought with it to the mind of <LOC> in that age,--already secure, in its own indigenous development, already advancing to its own great maturity under the scholastic culture--the meagre Scholastic, and the rich Romantic culture--of <ORG>.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.8571832776069641,0.8571832776069641,-3.0900065898895264
121,"Of course, this was unheard by the officers. <PER>, the <NUM> prisoner, only cringed and coughed under his punishment. He had some pulmonary complaint. He was off duty for <DATE> after the flogging; but this was partly to be imputed to his extreme mental misery. It was his <NUM> scourging, and he felt the insult more than the injury. He became silent and sullen for the rest of the cruise. The <NUM> and last was <PER>, the mizzen-top lad. He had often boasted that he had never been degraded at the gangway. <DATE> before his cheek had worn its usual red but now no ghost was whiter. As he was being secured to the gratings, and the shudderings and creepings of his dazzlingly white back were revealed, he turned round his head imploringly; but his weeping entreaties and vows of contrition were of no avail. “I would not forgive God Almighty!” cried the Captain. The <NUM> boatswain’s-mate advanced, and at the <NUM> blow, the boy, shouting “_My God! Oh! my God!_” writhed and leaped so as to displace the gratings, and scatter the <NUM> tails of the scourge all over his person. At the next blow he howled, leaped, and raged in unendurable torture. “What are you stopping for, boatswain’s-mate?” cried the Captain. “Lay on!” and the whole dozen was applied. “I don’t care what happens to me now!” wept <PER>, going among the crew, with blood-shot eyes, as he put on his shirt. “I have been flogged once, and they may do it again, if they will. Let them look for me now!” “Pipe down!” cried the Captain, and the crew slowly dispersed. Let us have the charity to believe them—as we do—when some Captains in the <ORG> say, that the thing of all others most repulsive to them, in the routine of what they consider their duty, is the administration of corporal punishment upon the crew; for, surely, not to feel scarified to the quick at these scenes would argue a man but a beast. You see a human being, stripped like a slave; scourged worse than a hound. And for what? For things not essentially criminal, but only made so by arbitrary laws. CHAPTER XXXIV.

122,"It was a time when puns, and charades, and enigmas, and anagrams, and monograms, and ciphers, and puzzles, were not good for sport and child's play merely; when they had need to be close; when they had need to be solvable, at least, only to those who _should_ solve them. It was a time when all the latent capacities of the English language were put in requisition, and it was flashing and crackling, through all its lengths and breadths, with puns and quips, and conceits, and jokes, and satires, and inlined with philosophic secrets that opened down ""into the bottom of a tomb""--that opened into the Tower--that opened on the scaffold and the block.' I quote, likewise, another passage, because I think the reader will see in it the noble earnestness of the author's character, and may partly imagine the sacrifices which this research has cost her:-- 'The great secret of the <LOC> age did not lie where any superficial research could ever have discovered it. It was not left within the range of any accidental disclosure. It did not lie on the surface of any <LOC> document. The most diligent explorers of these documents, in <DATE>, had not found it.

It was buried in the inmost recesses of the esoteric <LOC> learning. It was tied with a knot that had passed the scrutiny and baffled the sword of an old, suspicious, dying, military government--a knot that none could cut--a knot that must be untied. 'The great secret of the Elizabethan Age was inextricably reserved by the founders of a new learning, the prophetic and more nobly gifted minds of a new and nobler race of men, for a research that should test the mind of the discoverer, and frame and subordinate it to that so sleepless and indomitable purpose of the prophetic aspiration. It was ""the device"" by which they undertook to live again in the ages in which their achievements and triumphs were forecast, and to come forth and rule again, not in <NUM> mind, not in the few, not in the many, but in all.

An intuition bade her refrain, but the sense of dishonesty was more than the child could bear; so <TIME>, during the hair braiding, she had confessed. She began thus:-- “I wrote to my father and mother <TIME> how good you were to me.” “Did you tell them how good you were to me?” asked the girl, so kindly that the child's heart leaped within her and she more than ever wished that she had nothing to confess. “I wish I could be, cousin <PER>; I meant to be, but error crept in.” The girl was learning something of the new phraseology, and she smiled at <ORG> in the glass and was surprised to find what troubled eyes met hers. “I went to sleep that <TIME> waiting for grandpa to be through with his book, and when I waked up he had read my letter.” <PER>'s smile faded. “Tell me again what you said in it,” she returned. <ORG>'s lips quivered. “I said how kind you were, and washed my hair, and asked me not to tell grandpa--” “You put that in?” <PER> interrupted eagerly. The child took courage from her changed tone. “Yes; I said you didn't want him to know you were kind to me.” The girl smiled slightly and went on with her brushing. “He wished he hadn't read it when he saw how sorry I was. He asked my pardon and said he had done bad form. I don't know what that is.” “It's the worst thing that can happen to some people,” returned <PER>. “Good form is said to be the <LOC> conscience.” “Oh,” responded <ORG>, not understanding, but too relieved and grateful that her cousin was not unforgiving to press the matter. <PER> fell into thought.

129,"There is little to be wondered at, if this matter of curriculum was treated by the more passive scholars as a matter of course, and by the sharper and less reverent disciples as a matter of fun.

When <PER>, for example, makes use of the legend of <ORG>, in his _Wife of Bath’s Tale_, he makes, not <ORG>’s minister, but his queen, tell the mighty secret—and thus secures another hit at woman’s loquacity.

131,"That is the figure that it makes when it comes to be laid in its state-bed, upon the scientific table of review, not in the formal manner of 'the <NUM> part' of this philosophy, but in that other manner which the author of the _Novum Organum_, speaks of so frequently, as the one to be used in applying it to subjects of this nature.

133,"To separate the man and the philosopher--to fly out upon the _man_, to throw him overboard with every expression of animosity and disgust, to make him out as bad as possible, to collect diligently every scrap of evidence against him, and set it forth with every conceivable aggravation--this has been the resource of an indignant scholarship in this case, bent on uttering its protest in some form; this has been the defence of learning, cast down from its excellency, and debased in all men's eyes, as it seemed for ever, in the person of its high-priest. The objection to the work here presented to the public is, that it does not go far enough. From the point of review that the research of which it is the fruit has now attained, this is the criticism to which it appears to be liable. From this point of view, the _complaint_ to be made against it is, that at the place where it stops it leaves, for want of that part of the evidence which contains it, the historical grandeur of our great men unrevealed or still obscured. For we _have_ had them, in the sober day-light of our occidental learning, in the actualities of history, and not in the mists of a poetic past only--monstrous idealisms, outstretched shadows of man's divinity, demi-gods and heroes, impersonations of ages and peoples, stalking through the twilight of the ante-historic dawn, or in the twilight of a national popular ignorance, embalmed in the traditions of those who are always 'beginners.' We have had them; we need not look to a foreign and younger race for them; we have them, fruit of our own stock; we have had them, not cloaked with falseness, but exposed in the searching noonday glare of our western science. We have had them, we have them still, with all their mortal frailty and littleness and ignorance confessed, with all their 'weaved-up follies ravelled out,' with all the illimitable capacity of affection and passion and will in man, with all his illimitable capacity for folly and wrong-doing, assumed and acknowledged in their own persons, symbolically, vicariously, assumed and confessed.

149,"And thus, by describing human nature under that term, or by repeating and stating the common opinions as his own, he is enabled to create an opposition which could not exist, so long as they remain unconsciously operative, or infolded in the separate individuality, as a part of its own particular form.

While I publish and accuse my own imperfections, somebody will learn to be afraid of them. _The parts that I most esteem in myself_, are more honoured in decrying than in commending _my own manners_.

And they were men of a different turn of mind entirely from those who lay themselves out on enterprises having that tendency. The result of this English survey of learning was the sanctioned and organised determination of the modern speculation to those new fields which it has already occupied, and its organised, but secret determination, to that end of a true learning which the need of man, in its whole comprehension in _this_ theory of it, constitutes. But the men with whom this proceeding originates, <ORG>, were, in their own time, 'the Few.'

Was it strange that these men should find themselves without sympathy in an age like that?--an age in which the masses were still unlettered, callous with wrongs, manacled with blind traditions, or swaying hither and thither, with the breath of a common prejudice or passion, or swayed hither and thither by the changeful humours and passions, or the conflicting dogmas and conceits of their rulers.

It had to affect, in that time, bookishness and wiry scholasticism. It had to put on sedulously the harmless old monkish gown, or the jester's cap and bells, or any kind of a tatterdemalion robe that would hide, from head to heel, the waving of its purple.

153,"He does not care to tell us,--he _could not_ well tell us, in _popular_ language, what the true name of that height of learning is: he could not well name without circumlocution, that height which a scientific abstraction makes,--an abstraction that attains simplicity without destroying the concrete reality, an abstraction that attains as its result only a higher history,--a new and more intelligible reading of it,--a solution of it--that which is fixed and constant and accounts for it,--an abstraction whose apex of unity is the highest, the universal history, that which accounts for all,--the equivalent,--the scientific equivalent of it. But whatever it be, it is something that is going to take the place of the unscientific abstractions, both in theory and practice; it is something that is going to supplant ultimately the vain indolent speculation, the inert because unscientific speculation, that seeks to bind the human life in the misery of an enforced and sanctioned ignorance, sealing up with its dogmas to an eternal collision with the universal laws of God and nature,--laws that no dogma or conceit can alter,--all the unreckoned generations of the life of man.

The unity to which all things in nature, inspired with her universal instinct tend,--the unity of which the mind and heart of man in its sympathy with the universal whole is but an expression, that unity of its own which the mind is always seeking to impart to the diversities which the unreconciled experience offers it, which it must have in its objective reality, which it will make for itself if it cannot find it, which it _does_ make in ignorant ages, by falling back upon its own form and ignoring the historic reality,--which it builds up without any solid objective basis, by ignoring the nature of things, or founds on <NUM>-sided partial views of their nature, that unity is going to have its place in the new learning also--but it is going to be henceforth the unity of knowledge--not of dogmas, not of belief merely, for knowledge, and not belief merely,--knowledge, and not opinion, is _power_.

The housekeeper and coachman both stood at attention, the latter mechanically pulling down his rolled-up sleeves. “So you're moving out here, Mrs. <PER>,” was the remark with which the newcomer announced himself. “Yes, Mr. <PER>. The man has been here to put in the electric bell you ordered. I shall be as quick to call as if I was still in the house, sir, and I thank you--'Zekiel and I both do--for consenting to my making it home-like for him. Perhaps you'd come up and see the rooms, sir?” “Not just now. Some other time. I hope '<PER> is going to prove himself worth all this trouble.” The new coachman's countenance seemed frozen into a stolidity which did not alter. “I'm sure he'll try,” replied his mother, “and <PER>'s livery fits him to such a turn that it would have been flying in the face of <PER> not to try him.

176,"The law of DUTY, as the NATURAL LAW of human society; the law of humanity, as the law, nay, THE FORM, of the HUMAN kind, stamped on it with the <PER>'s stamp, that _order_ from the universal law of kinds that gives to all life its SPECIAL bounds, its '_border_ in _itself_'--that form so _essential_, that there is no _humanity_ or _kind-ness_ where that is not--that law which we hear so much of, in its narrower aspects, under various names, in all men's speech, is produced here, in its broader relations, as the necessary basis of a scientific social art. And it is this author's deliberate opinion as a Naturalist, it is the opinion of <ORG>, from which this work proceeds, that those who undertake to compose human societies, large or small, whether in families, or states, or empires, without recognising this principle--those who undertake to compose <ORG>, human unions and societies, on any other principle--will have a diabolical jangle of it when all is done. For this law of _unity_, which is written on the soul of man, this law of CONSCIENCE _within, is written without also_; and to erase it _within_ is to get the lesson from _without_ in that universal and downright speech and language which the axioms of nature are taught in--it is to get it in that fearful school in which nature _repeats_ the doctrine of her violated law, for those who are not able to solve and comprehend the science of it as it is _written_--written beforehand--in the natural law and constitutions of the human soul.

179,"They are a set of rough and hardy yeomen, much inferior, as respects refinement, to the corresponding classes in most other parts of our country. This is the more remarkable, as there is scarcely a family in the vicinity that has not provided, for <NUM> of its sons, the advantages of a ""liberal education."" Having thus described the present state of <ORG>, we must proceed to speak of it as it existed <DATE> since, when its foundation was recent, and its prospects flattering. At the head of the institution, at this period, was a learned and Orthodox divine, whose fame was in all the churches. He was the author of several works which evinced much erudition and depth of research; and the public, perhaps, thought the more highly of his abilities from a singularity in the purposes to which he applied them, that added much to the curiosity of his labors, though little to their usefulness. But, however fanciful might be his private pursuits, Dr. <PER>, it was universally allowed, was diligent and successful in the arts of instruction. The young men of his charge prospered beneath his eye, and regarded him with an affection that was strengthened by the little foibles which occasionally excited their ridicule. The president was assisted in the discharge of his duties by <NUM> inferior officers, chosen from the alumni of the college, who, while they imparted to others the knowledge they had already imbibed, pursued the study of divinity under the direction of their principal. Under such auspices the institution grew and flourished. Having at that time but <NUM> rivals in the country (neither of them within a considerable distance), it became the general resort of the youth of the Province in which it was situated. For <DATE> in succession, its students amounted to nearly fifty,--a number which, relatively to the circumstances of the country, was very considerable. From the exterior of the collegians, an accurate observer might pretty safely judge how long they had been inmates of those classic walls.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9878441095352173,0.9878441095352173,-0.22988569736480713
180,"The doctrine of this Play is, that those same powers which are at work in man's life, are at work without it also; that they are powers which belong, in their highest form, to the nature of things in general; and that man himself, with all his special distinctions, is under the law of that universal constitution. The scientific remedy for the state of things which this play exhibits is the knowledge of 'causes in nature,' which must be found here, as in the other case, by scientific investigation--the spontaneous method leading to no better result here than in the other case. Under cover of the excitements of this play, this inquiry is boldly opened, and the track of the new science is clearly marked in it. Poor <ORG> is, indeed, compelled to leave the practical improvement of _his_ hints for another; and when it comes to the open question of the remedy for this state of things, which is the term of the inquiry, when he undertakes to put his absolute power in motion for the avowed purpose of effecting an improvement here, he appears indeed disposed to treat the subject in the most savage and despairing manner--that is, on his own account; but the vein of the scientific inquiry still runs unbroken through all this burst of passion. For in his scorn for that failure in human nature and human life of which society, as he finds it, stands convicted--that failure to establish the distinctive law of the human kind--that failure from which he is suffering so deeply--and in his struggle to express that disgust, he proposes, as an improvement on the state of things he finds, a law which shall obliterate that human distinction; though certainly _that_ is anything but the Poet's remedy; and the poor king himself does not appear to be in earnest, for the moral disgust in which the distinctive sentiment of the nobler nature, and the knowledge of _human_ good and evil betrays itself, breaks forth in floods of passion that overflow all the bounds of articulation before he can make an end of it. But the radical nature of this question of _natural causes_, which the practical theory of the social arts must comprehend, is already indicated in this play, in the very beginning of the action.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9834116697311401,0.9834116697311401,-0.4660536050796509
183,"It is not merely that he will have his axioms and precepts of direction digested from the facts, instead of being made out of the teacher's own brains, but he will have THE FACTS themselves, in all their stubbornness and opposition to the teacher's preconceptions, for the body of the discourse, and the precepts accommodated thereto, instead of having the precepts for the body of the discourse, and the facts brought in to wait upon them. That is the form of the practical doctrine. He regrets that this part of a true learning has not been collected hitherto into writing, to the great derogation of learning, and the professors of learning; for from this proceeds the popular opinion which has passed into an adage, that there is no great concurrence between wisdom and learning. The deficiency here is well nigh total he says: 'but for the wisdom of business, wherein man's life is most conversant, there be no books of it, except some few scattered advertisements, that have no proportion to the _magnitude of the subject_. For if books were written of this, as of the other, I doubt not but _learned men_ with _mean experience_ would far excel men of _long experience without learning_, and _outshoot them with their own bow_. Neither need it be thought that this knowledge is too variable to fall under precept,' he says; and he mentions the fact, that in old <LOC>, so renowned for practical ability, in its wisest and saddest times, there were professors of this learning, that were known for GENERAL WISE MEN, who used to walk at certain <TIME> in the place, and give _advice_ to private citizens, who came to consult with them of the _marriage_ of _a daughter_, for instance, or the _employing_ of _a son_, or of _an accusation_, or of a _purchase or bargain_, and _every other occasion incident to man's life_. There is a pretty scheme laid out truly. Have _we_ any general wise man, or ghost of one, who walks up and down at certain <TIME> and gives advice on such topics? However that may be, this philosopher does not despair of such a science. 'So,' he says, commenting on that Roman custom, 'there is a wisdom of council and advice, even in private cases, arising out of a universal _insight into the affairs_ of _the world_, which is _used_ indeed upon _particular cases propounded_, but is gathered by general _observation_ of _cases_ of _like nature_.'",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9565142393112183,0.9565142393112183,-3.103422164916992
184,"But, at the same time, the hindrances that a practical learning has to encounter are pointed at from the <NUM>. The fact, that the true ends of learning take us at once into the ground of the forbidden questions, is as plainly stated in the opening speech of <ORG> as the nature of the statement will permit. The fact, that the intellect is trained to _vain delights_ under such conditions, because there is no earnest legitimate occupation of it permitted, is a fact that is glanced at here, as it is in other places, though not in such a manner, of course, as to lead to a 'question' from the government in regard to the meaning of the passages in which these grievances are referred to. Under these embarrassments it is, we are given to understand, however, that the criticism on the old learning and the plot for the new is about to proceed. Here it takes the form of comedy and broad farce. There is a touch of 'tart <ORG>' in the representation here. This is the introductory performance of the school in which the student hopes for _high words howsoever low the matter_, emphasizing that hope with an allusion to the heights of learning, as he finds it, and the highest word of it, which seems irreverent, until we find from the whole purport of the play how far _he_ at least is from taking it _in vain_, whatever implication of that sort his criticism may be intended to leave on others, who use good words with so much iteration and to so little purpose. 'That is a _high hope_ for a low having' is the rejoinder of that associate of his, whose views on this point agree with his own so entirely. It is the height of the _hope_ and the lowness of the _having_--it is the height of the _words_ and the lowness of the _matter_, that makes the incongruity here. That is the soul of all the mirth that is stirring here. It is the height of '_the style_' that '_gives us cause to climb in the merriment_' that makes the subject of this essay. It is literature in general that is laughed at here, and the branches of it in particular. It is the old books that are walking about under these trees, with their follies all ravelled out, making sport for us.

The voices swelled:-- “O'er waiting harpstrings of the mind There sweeps a strain, Low, sad, and sweet, whose measures bind The power of pain.” The girl in the white dress did not sing. She swallowed often. The voice of the child at her side soared easily. “And o'er earth's troubled, angry sea, I see Christ walk; And come to me, and tenderly, <ORG>, talk.” What a haven of promise and peace seemed this sunny, simple place of purity. “From tired joy and grief afar, And nearer Thee, Father, where Thine own children are I love to be.” <PER>, looking up at her companion, was surprised to see her lashes wet and her lower lip caught between her teeth. “What's the matter, cousin <PER>?” she whispered softly as they sat down.

Mrs. <PER> hesitated. “Your mother is a dressmaker, isn't she?” “Yes, she's just a splendid one. Everybody says so. We couldn't be poor, you know.

Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence.

""No, you are not like the slender boy of <NUM>, who stood on the hill by moonlight to take a last look at his father's cottage. There were tears in your eyes then; and, as often as I remember them, I repent that I did not turn you back, instead of leading you on."" ""Tears, were there? Well, there have been few enough since,"" said his comrade, pressing his eyelids firmly together, as if even then tempted to give way to the weakness that he scorned. ""And, for turning me back, <PER>, it was beyond your power. I had taken my resolution, and you did but show me the way to execute it."" ""You have not inquired after those you left behind,"" observed <PER>. ""No--no; nor will I have aught of them,"" exclaimed the traveller, starting from his seat, and pacing rapidly across the room.

Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, <PER>?” “No one did at <NUM>; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt.

During this interval, <NUM> of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on <TIME> of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, <PER> was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner. This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. <PER>, poor, good <PER>, is innocent.” At that instant my father entered.

208,"I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. <PER> was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of <DATE>, tempest and calm, the silence of <DATE>, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember. On the birth of a <NUM> son, my junior by <DATE>, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house in <LOC>, and a _campagne_ on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.

He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and <ORG> adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of <PER>, of <ORG>, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.

209,"“He forgave him for it,” he said, “from the very bottom of his heart; and for himself (Mr. <PER>), so far from pushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry to say, really had arisen against Mr. <PER>, he (Mr. <PER>) would make every exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his possession to—to—to—soften down, as much as he could conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly perplexing piece of business.” Mr. <PER> went on for <TIME> longer in this strain, very much to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted people are seldom apposite in their observations—they run into all sorts of blunders, <PER> and mal apropos-isms, in the hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend—thus, often with the kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his cause than to advance it. So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of “Old Charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected, yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse against him the fury of the mob. <NUM> of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his allusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr. <PER>.” The people had really never thought of this before. They had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a <DATE> or <NUM> previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance as a matter that was settled—so single-minded a race of beings were the <ORG>; but the remark of “Old <PER>” brought them at once to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat.

But the philosopher on this occasion, having produced such a variety of precedents from natural history, appears to be satisfied with the propriety and justice of the proceeding, inasmuch as beasts and men seem to be treated with impartial consideration in it; and though a certain distinction of form appears to obtain according to the species, the main fact is throughout identical.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9834614992141724,0.9834614992141724,-0.40191924571990967

'We certainly intend to comprehend them ALL.' _That_ is _the author's_ answer to it. 'And as _common logic_ which _regulates matters by syllogism_, is applied, not only to natural, but to every other science, _so_ our inductive method _likewise_ comprehends them ALL.' With such iteration will he think fit to give us this point. It is put in here for those 'who raise the question'--the question 'rather than objection.' The other sort are taken care of in other places. '_For_,' he continues, 'we form a history and tables of invention, for _anger, fear, shame,_ and _the like_; and _also for examples in civil life_' [that was to be the principal part of the science when he laid out the plan of it in the advancement of learning] 'and the _mental_ operations of _memory, composition, division, judgment_, and the rest; _as well_ as for _heat_ and _cold, light_ and _vegetation_, and _the like_.'

These biographical and literary points have been dealt with in an introduction for which the kindest help was long ago received from the late Dr. <PER> and the late Lord <PER>. Sir <PER> was also among the <NUM> to give both encouragement and guidance. My friends <PER> and Mr. <PER> have read the book in manuscript. The authorities of <ORG> and of <ORG> have been as generously helpful as is their well-known wont. To all the editor wishes to record his acknowledgements and thanks. <ORG>. INTRODUCTION. <PER> ‘The compositions published in Mrs. <PER>’s <DATE> afford but an inadequate conception of the intense sensibility and mental vigour of this extraordinary woman.’ Thus wrote Dr. <PER>, in <DATE> (Preface to his _Relics of <PER>_). The words of praise may have sounded unexpectedly warm at that date. Perhaps the present volume will make the reader more willing to subscribe, or less inclined to demur. <PER> in her younger days certainly possessed a fair share of that nimbleness of invention which generally characterizes women of letters. Her favourite pastime as a child, she herself testifies, had been to write stories. And a dearer pleasure had been—to use her own characteristic abstract and elongated way of putting it—‘the following up trains of thought which had for their subject the formation of a succession of imaginary incidents’. All readers of <PER>’s life remember how later on, as a girl of <NUM>—and <DATE>’ wife—she was present, ‘a devout but nearly silent listener’, at the long symposia held by her husband and <PER> in <LOC> (<DATE>), and how the pondering over ‘German horrors’, and a common resolve to perpetrate ghost stories of their own, led her to imagine that most unwomanly of all feminine romances, _<PER>_.",unknown,OscarWilde,0.9928701519966125,0.9928701519966125,-0.5602843761444092
225,"I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. <PER>’s to give an account of yourself.” “Who is Mr. <PER>? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free country?” “Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. <PER> is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here <TIME>.” This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in <TIME> to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death. I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection. Chapter 21 I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion. <NUM> men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing <TIME> before with his son and brother-in-law, <PER>, when, about ten o’clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a <LOC> about two miles below. He walked on <NUM>, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9874118566513062,0.9874118566513062,-0.723680853843689
226,"For it was the old northern genius, under the influence, not of the revival of the learning of antiquity only, but of that accumulated influence which its previous revival on the Continent brought with it here; under the influence, too, of that insular nurture, which began so soon to colour and insulate English history;--'Britain is a world by itself,' says <PER>, 'and we will nothing pay,' etc.--it was the old northern genius nurtured in the cradle of that 'bravery' which had written its page of fire in the Roman Caesar's story--which had arrested the old classic historian's pen, and fired it with a poet's prophecy, and taught _him_ too how to pronounce from the old _British_ hero's lip the burning speech of _English_ freedom;--it was that which began to show itself here, then, in that new tongue, which we call the '_<LOC>_.' It was that which could not fit its words to its mouth as it had a mind to do under those conditions, and was glad to know that 'the audience was deferred.'

Behind this was a deep green valley, with distinct hills on either side.

254,"In the scene that follows, we have, in the Poet's arrangement, the great historic spectacle of a people 'REVOKING THEIR IGNORANT ELECTION,' under the instigation and guidance of those same remarkable leaders, whose voice had been wanting (as they are careful to inform us) till then in the business of the state; leaders who contrive at last to inform the people, in plain terms, that they 'are at point to lose their liberties,' that '<PER> will have all from them,' and who apologise for their conduct afterwards by saying, that 'he affected <NUM> sole throne, _without assistance_'; for the time had come when the <ORG> could repeat the Poet's whisper, 'The _one_ side shall have _bale_.' This so critical spectacle is boldly brought out and exhibited here in all its actual historical detail.

The fault with the popular and instinctive mode of inquiry is, he tells us, that _it begins with affirmation_--but that is the method for gods, and not men--men must begin with negations; they must have tables of _review_ of instances, tables of negation, tables of rejection; and _divide_ nature, not with fire, but with the mind, that divine fire.

255,"""If you had the means of taking him, I should save him from your cruelty, thus,"" said <PER>, dropping a pebble into the water, just over the fish. ""There! he has darted down the stream. How many pleasant caves and recesses there must be under these banks, where he may be happy! May there not be happiness in the life of a fish?"" she added, turning with a smile to <PER>. ""There may,"" he replied, ""so long as he lives quietly in the caves and recesses of which you speak, Yes, there may be happiness, though such as few would envy; but, then, the hook and line""-- ""Which, there is reason to apprehend, will shortly destroy the happiness of our friend the trout,"" interrupted <PER>, pointing down the stream. ""There is an angler on his way toward us, who will intercept him."" ""He seems to care little for the sport, to judge by the pace at which he walks,"" said <PER>. ""But he sees, now, that we are observing him, and is willing to prove that he knows something of the art,"" replied <PER>. ""I should think him well acquainted with the stream; for, hastily as he walks, he has tried every pool and ripple where a fish usually hides. But that point will be decided when he reaches yonder old bare oak-tree."" ""And how is the old tree to decide the question?"" inquired <PER>. ""It is a species of evidence of which I have never before heard."" ""The stream has worn a hollow under its roots,"" answered Edward,--""a most delicate retreat for a trout. Now, a stranger would not discover the spot; or, if he did, the probable result of a cast would be the loss of hook and line,--an accident that has occurred to me more than once. If, therefore, this angler takes a fish from thence, it follows that he knows the stream."" They observed the <ORG>, accordingly, as he kept his way up the bank. He did not pause when he reached the old leafless oak, that formed with its roots an obstruction very common in American streams; but, throwing his line with involuntary skill as he passed, he not only escaped the various entanglements, but drew forth a fine large fish. ""There, <PER>, he has captivated your _protégé_, the trout, or, at least, <NUM> very like him in size,"" observed <PER>.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9860792756080627,0.9860792756080627,-0.34119081497192383
256,"And fortifying himself with the example of <PER>, after collecting a string of texts from the Sacred Proverbs, he adds, 'though they are capable, of course, of a more divine interpretation, taking them as instructions for life, they might have received large discourse, if he would have _broken them_ and _illustrated them_, by deducements and examples. Nor was this in use with the Hebrews only, but it is generally to be found in the wisdom of the more ancient times, that as men found out any observation that they thought was _good for life_, they would gather it, and express it in _parable_, or _aphorism_, or _fable_.' But for _fables_, they were vicegerents and supplies, _where examples failed_. Now that the times abound with history, THE <ORG> IS BETTER WHEN THE MARK IS ALIVE. And, therefore, he recommends as the form of writing, 'which is of all others fittest for this variable argument, discourses upon histories and examples: for knowledge drawn freshly, _and in our view_, out of particulars, _knoweth the way best to particulars again_; and it hath much greater life _for practice_, when _the discourse attendeth upon the example_, than when the example attendeth upon the discourse. For this is no point of order as it seemeth at <NUM>' (indeed it is not, it is a point as substantial as the difference between the old learning of the world and the new)--'this is no point of order, but of substance. For when the example is the _ground_ being set down in a history at large, it is set down with all circumstances, which may _sometimes control_ the discourse thereupon made, and sometimes supply it as _a very pattern for action_; whereas the examples which are alleged _for the discourse's sake_, are cited succinctly and without _particularity_, and carry a _servile aspect_ towards the discourse which they are brought in to make good.' The question of method is here, as we see, incidentally introduced; but it is to be noted, and it makes <NUM> of the rules for the interpretation of that particular kind of style which is under consideration, that in this casual and secondary introduction of a subject, we often get shrewder hints of the author's real intention than we do in those parts of the work where it is openly and distinctly treated; at least, these scattered and apparently accidental hints,--these dispersed directions, often contain the key for the '<NUM>' reading, which he openly bespeaks for the more open and elaborate discussion.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.8383768200874329,0.8383768200874329,-4.67557954788208
258,"And having thus ventured to express his surprise at this deficiency, he proceeds to note what only indications he observes of any work at all in this field, and the very quarters he goes to for these little accidental hints and beginnings of such a science, show how utterly it was wanting in those grandiloquent schools of philosophic theory, and those magisterial chairs of direction, which the author found in possession of this department in his time. 'A man shall find in the traditions of <ORG>, some pretty and apt _divisions of men's natures_,'--so in the discussions which occur on this same point in <ORG>, where this part of philosophy comes under a more particular consideration, and the great ministry which it would yield to morality and policy is suggested in a different form, this same reference to the astrological observations repeatedly occurs. The Poet, indeed, discards the astrological _theory _of these natural differences in the dispositions of men, but is evidently in favour of an observation, and inquiry of some sort, into the <NUM> causes of these 'sequent effects,' and an anatomy of the living subject is in <NUM> case suggested, by a person who is suffering much from the deficiencies of science in this field, as a means of throwing light on it. 'Then let <PER> be anatomised.' For in the _Play_,--in the poetic impersonation, which has a scientific purpose for its object, the historical extremes of these natural differences are touched, and brought into the most vivid dramatic oppositions; so as to force from the lips of the by-standers the very inquiries and suggestions which are put down here; so as to wring from the broken hearts of men--tortured and broken on the wheel, which 'blind men' call fortune,--tortured and broken on the rack of an unlearned and barbaric human society,--or, from hearts that do not break with anything that such a world can do, the imperious direction of the new science. 'Then let <PER> be anatomised, and _see_ what it is that breeds about her heart.' He has asked already, 'What is the cause of thunder?' But '_his_ philosopher' must not stop there. 'Is there any _cause_--is there any cause _in nature_ that makes these hard hearts?' -- It is _the stars_! The stars above us govern our conditions, Else one self mate and mate could not beget Such different issues.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9630056023597717,0.9630056023597717,-1.4537372589111328

At <NUM> he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he endeavored to dissuade Mr. <PER>’s other friends from making a stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile—say for <DATE> or <NUM>, or <DATE>, or <NUM>—to see if something wouldn’t turn up, or if Mr. <PER> wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain his reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often observed this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who are labouring under any very poignant sorrow.

272,"Again; the desire of a private good does not, _in general_, prevail against that of a public one, except where the _quantities are small_' [it is the general _law_ he is propounding here; and the exception, the anomaly, is that which he has to note]; 'would that such were the case in civil matters.' But that application to 'civil matters,' which the statesman, propounding in his own person this newly-collected knowledge of the actual historic forces, as a new and immeasurable source of relief to the human estate,--that application, which he could only make here in these side-long glances, is made in the Play without any difficulty at all. These instances, which he produces here in his professed work of science, are produced as illustrations of the kind of inquiry which he is going to bring to bear, with all the force and subtlety of his genius, on the powers of nature, as manifested in the individual human nature, and in those unions and aggregations to which it tends--those larger wholes and greater congregations, which parliaments, and pulpits, and play-houses, and books, were forbidden then, on pain of death and torture and ignominy, to meddle with. _Here_, he tells us, he finds it to the purpose to select '_suggestive_ instances, such as _point out_ that which is advantageous to mankind'; 'and it is a part of science to make _judicious_ inquiries and wishes.'

This is the philosophy precisely which underlies all this Play,--this Play, in which the great question, not yet ready for the handling of the unlearned, but ripe already for scientific treatment,--the question of the wrestling forces,--the question of the subjection and predominance of powers,--the question of the combination and opposition of forces in those _arrested motions_ which make _states_, is so boldly handled.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9854602217674255,0.9854602217674255,-0.4539377987384796

""Another time, perhaps,"" she suggested. ""Why not now, since we are here,"" returned Mrs. <PER> calmly. ""A haunted house isn't to be seen every day."" She smiled. ""Do join your friend, Mr. <PER>. He seems to have found some view well worth looking at. We shall not stay long."" ""Oh, take your time,"" returned <PER>, seeing that he could not prevent the intrusion, and altering his manner to that of a host. ""Perhaps you would like to see my artist camp as you call it. I did find one spot where there is a dry season and my canvases can be safe."" He led the way into the farmhouse. The paper on the little hallway in oval designs of faded green landscapes had peeled and was hanging from the wall. They passed into a living-room where tattered and splintered furniture and a rusty stove met the eye. Back of this was the artist's den evidently. A table stood in the center, on which reposed a palette, some brushes, a couple of sketch-books, and a portfolio. Against the side of the room were a few canvases leaning against the wall, and in bold relief, supported against the table, stood a pickaxe and a shovel. Mrs. <PER> regarded <PER>'s flushed countenance as he picked up the tools and pushed them behind a screen. ""Your still-life studies, appropriate to an abandoned farm?"" she laughed. ""They don't look very artistic, I must say,"" returned <PER>.

I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply. <PER> was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of <PER>. “D—n the fellow!” cried he; “why, <PER>, I assure you he has outstript us all.

Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, <PER>: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.” <PER> had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me. <PER> had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the <LOC>, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9901111721992493,0.9901111721992493,-1.0305252075195312

303,"And thus we are able to collect, from every part of this proposal for a practical and progressive human learning, based on the defects of the unpractical and stationary learning which the world has hitherto been contented with, the author's opinion as to the form of delivery and inculcation best adapted to effect the proposed object under the given conditions. This question of form runs naturally through the whole work, and comes out in specifications of a very particular and significant kind under some of its divisions, as we shall see. But everywhere we find the point insisted on, which we have just seen so clearly brought out, in the department which was to contain the axioms of success in private life. Whatever the particular form may be, everywhere we come upon this general rule. Whatever the particular form may be, everywhere it is to be one in which the facts shall have the precedence, and the conclusions shall follow; and not one in which the conclusions stand <NUM>, and the facts are brought in to make them good. And this very circumstance is enough of itself to show that the form of this new doctrine will be thus far new, as new as the doctrine itself; that the new learning will be found in some form very different, at least, from that which the philosophers and professed teachers were then making use of in their didactic discourses, in some form so much more lively than that, and so much less oracular, that it would, perhaps, appear at <NUM>, to those accustomed only to the other, not to be any kind of learning at all, but something very different from that. But this is not the only point in the general doctrine of delivery which we find produced again in its specific applications. Through all the divisions of this discourse on <ORG>, and not in that part of it only in which the Art of its <ORG> is openly treated, we find that the prescribed form of it is one which will adapt it to the popular preconceptions; and that it must be a form which will make it not only universally acceptable, but universally attractive; that it is not only a form which will throw open the gates of the new school to all comers, but one that will bring in mankind to its benches.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9794249534606934,0.9794249534606934,-0.6455884575843811

By a happy coincidence, <ORG>, it seems, had discovered this Author in the obscurity of his clerkship in <LOC>, and had determined to make use of his own influence at court to push his brother poet's fortunes there; but his efforts to benefit this poor bard _personally_, do not appear to have been attended at any time with much success. The mysterious literary partnership between these <NUM>, however, which dates apparently from an earlier period, continues to bring forth fruit of the most successful kind; and the 'Faery Queene' is not the only product of it. All kinds of books began now to be dedicated to this new and so munificent patron of arts and letters. His biographers collect his public history, not from political records only, but from the eulogies of these manifold dedications. _<PER>_, the artist, publishes his Sketches of the New World through his aid. <ORG> dedicates his History of <LOC> to him; <LOC>, his <LOC> to <LOC>.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9736782312393188,0.9736782312393188,-0.9373252987861633
309,"HE GIVES SOME ACCOUNT OF <NUM> OF HIS SHIPMATES CALLED <PER> While we sat eating our beef and biscuit, <NUM> of the men got into a dispute, about who had been sea-faring the longest; when <PER>, who had mixed the _burgoo,_ called upon them in a loud voice to cease their clamor, for he would decide the matter for them. Of this sailor, I shall have something more to say, as I get on with my narrative; so, I will here try to describe him a little. Did you ever see a man, with his hair shaved off, and just recovered from the yellow fever? Well, just such a looking man was this sailor. He was as yellow as gamboge, had no more whisker on his cheek, than I have on my elbows. His hair had fallen out, and left him very bald, except in the nape of his neck, and just behind the ears, where it was stuck over with short little tufts, and looked like a worn-out shoe-brush. His nose had broken down in the middle, and he squinted with <NUM> eye, and did not look very straight out of the other. He dressed a good deal like a <PER> boy; for he despised the ordinary sailor-rig; wearing a pair of great over-all blue trowsers, fastened with suspenders, and <NUM> red woolen shirts, <NUM> over the other; for he was subject to the rheumatism, and was not in good health, he said; and he had a large white wool hat, with a broad rolling brim. He was a native of <LOC> city, and had a good deal to say about _highlanders,_ and _rowdies,_ whom he denounced as only good for the gallows; but I thought he looked a good deal like a _highlander_ himself. His name, as I have said, was <PER>; and he told us, he was a near relation of General <PER> of <LOC>, and swore terribly, if any one ventured to question what he asserted on that head. In fact he was a great bully, and being the best seaman on board, and very overbearing every way, all the men were afraid of him, and durst not contradict him, or cross his path in any thing. And what made this more wonderful was, that he was the weakest man, bodily, of the whole crew; and I have no doubt that young and small as I was then, compared to what I am now, I could have thrown him down.",HermanMelville,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9470123648643494,0.9470123648643494,-1.6879204511642456

My mother has just come in. She is going with us to <LOC>."" A pause. ""She hopes to see you there. Good-bye."" Before the arrival of the <LOC> contingent at the island, <PER> received the following letter: _Dear <PER>_: You know the business that brought me to <LOC>. I proved my position all right. The old man's lawyer couldn't deny it, but the boy, not being named in the will, as, of course, I knew he wouldn't be, the lawyer said it would take a long time before he could get anything for <PER>, and advised me to put the boy into his hands. So I'm going to let him run matters to suit himself. I'm asking you if you will be good enough to pack up my stuff at the island and send everything on C.O.D. to the address on the card I enclose. You know what I found at the farm, but I've got to wait till I can get some backing before I can do anything about it. Keep it under your hat, though. You know what I left at the farm, too: out in the kitchen. Take that for your trouble. I don't know what I'm going to do next.

I'm disgusted with the world. Your friend, <PER> When he read this, <PER> looked off thoughtfully, his thin lips twitching. ""I hope <PER> can tell me all that's between those lines,"" he thought.

AMEN! AMEN! _Men_. A NOBLE wish. Thus far the Poet: but the mask through which he speaks is wanted for other purposes, for these occasional auto-biographical glimpses are but the side play of the great historical exhibition which is in progress here, and are introduced in entire subordination to its requisitions. It is, indeed, an old story into which all this <LOC> history is crowded. That mimic scene in which the great historic instances in the science of human nature and human life were brought out with such scientific accuracy, and with such matchless artistic power and splendour, was, in fact, what the <PER> himself, who ought to know, tells us it is; with so much emphasis,--not merely the mirror of nature in general, but the daguerreotype of the then yet living age, the plate which was able to give to the very _body_ of it, its _form and pressure_. That is what it was. And what is more, it was the only <ORG>, the only Spectator, the only <ORG>, in which the times could get reflected and deliberated on then, with any degree of freedom and vivacity. And yet there were minds here in <LOC> then, as acute, as reflective, as able to lead the popular mind as those that compose our leaders and reviews <DATE>. There was a mind here then, reflecting not 'ages past' only, but one that had taken its knowledge of the past from the present, that found 'in all men's lives,' a history figuring the nature of the times deceased; prophetic also: and this was the mind of the one who writes 'spirits are not finely touched but to fine issues.'",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.957413911819458,0.957413911819458,-1.4872891902923584
312,"The sturdiness with which he makes good his position, as an inhabitant, for the time being, of this terrestrial ball, and, by the ordinance of God, subject to its laws, and liable to its pains and penalties, is a thing which appears, to the careful reviewer of it, on the whole, the most novel and striking feature of this demonstration. He objects, on principle, to seizures and possessions of all kinds. He refuses to be taken off his feet by any kind of solicitation. He is a man who is never ashamed to have a reason,--one that he can produce, and make intelligible to common people, for his most exquisite proceedings; that is, if he chooses: but, 'if reasons were plentiful as blackberries,' he is not the man to give them on 'compulsion.' His ideas of the common mind, his notion of the common human intelligence, or capacity for intelligence, appears to be somewhat different from that of the other philosophers. The common sense--the common form--is that which he is always seeking and _identifying_ under all the differences. It is _that_ which he is bringing out and clothing with the 'inter-tissued robe' and all the glories which he has stripped from the extant majesty. 'Robes and furred gowns hide all' no longer. He is not a bard who is careful at all about keeping his singing robes about him. He can doff them and work like a 'navvy' when he sees reason. He is very fond of coming out with good, sober, solid prose, in the heart of his poetry. He can rave upon occasion as well as another. Spontaneities of all kinds have scope and verge enough in his plot; but he always keeps an eye out, and they speak no more than is set down for them. His Pythoness foams at the mouth too, sometimes, and appears to have it all her own way, perhaps; but he knows what she is about, and there is never a word in the oracle that has not undergone his revision. He knows that <PER> tells us 'it is in vain for a sober man to knock at the floor of the Muses'; but he is one who has discovered, scientifically, the human law; and he is ready to make it good, on all sides, against all comers.

313,"We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on <NUM> side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of <ORG>, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of <LOC> that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty <ORG> opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it. I took the hand of <PER>. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that <DATE> at least permits me to enjoy.” “Be happy, my dear <PER>,” replied <PER>; “there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice.

Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature appears!” Thus <PER> endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects.

314,"He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined. But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in <DATE>; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of <LOC>, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man <PER> to any but a violent death! Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, <NUM> contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas. When I was <DATE> we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advanced from behind the mountains of <ORG>, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.

315,"THE EXEMPLAR OF GOOD.--'And surely,' he continues, 'if the purpose be in good earnest, _not to write at leisure that which men may read at leisure_'--note it--that which men may read at leisure--'but really to _instruct_ and _suborn action and active life_, these GEORGICS of the MIND, concerning the husbandry and tillage thereof, are no less worthy than _the heroical descriptions of virtue, duty_, and _felicity_; therefore the _main and primitive division_ of MORAL KNOWLEDGE, seemeth to be into the <ORG> or PLATFORM of GOOD, and THE REGIMEN or CULTURE OF THE MIND, the one describing the NATURE of GOOD, the other prescribing RULES _how_ to <ORG>, APPLY, and ACCOMMODATE THE WILL OF MAN <ORG>.' As to '_the nature of good_, positive or simple,' the writers on this subject have, he says, 'set it down excellently, in describing the forms of virtue and duty, with their situations, and postures, in distributing them into their kinds, parts, provinces, actions, and administrations, and the like: nay, farther, they have commended them to man's nature and spirit, with great quickness of argument, and beauty of persuasions; yea, and fortified and entrenched them, _as much as discourse can do_, against corrupt and popular opinions. And for the degrees and comparative nature of good, they have excellently handled it also.' --That part deserveth to be reported for 'excellently laboured.' What is it that is wanting then? What radical, fatal defect is it that he finds even in the doctrine of the NATURE OF GOOD? What is the difficulty with this platform and exemplar of good as he finds it, notwithstanding the praise he has bestowed on it? The difficulty is, that it is not scientific. It is not broad enough. It is _special_, it is limited to the species, but it is not properly, it is not effectively, specific, because it is not connected with the doctrine of nature in general. It does not strike to those universal original principles, those simple powers which determine the actual historic laws and make the nature of things itself.

316,"There was no dusky discoloration to mark its internal track, as in the case when a partly-spent ball—obliquely hitting—after entering the skin, courses on, just beneath the surface, without penetrating further. Nor was there any mark on the opposite part of the thigh to denote its place, as when a ball forces itself straight through a limb, and lodges, perhaps, close to the skin on the other side. Nothing was visible but a small, ragged puncture, bluish about the edges, as if the rough point of a tenpenny nail had been forced into the flesh, and withdrawn. It seemed almost impossible, that through so small an aperture, a musket-bullet could have penetrated. The extreme misery and general prostration of the man, caused by the great effusion of blood—though, strange to say, at <NUM> he said he felt no pain from the wound itself—induced the <ORG>, very reluctantly, to forego an immediate search for the ball, to extract it, as that would have involved the dilating of the wound by the knife; an operation which, at that juncture, would have been almost certainly attended with fatal results. <DATE> or <NUM>, therefore, was permitted to pass, while simple dressings were applied. <ORG> of the other American ships of war in harbour occasionally visited the <PER>, to examine the patient, and incidentally to listen to the expositions of our own <ORG>, their senior in rank.

For already the horizon of that political oversight included, not the eventualities of <ORG> only, but the darker contingencies of those later political and social convulsions, from whose soundless whirlpools, men spring with joy to the hardest sharpest ledge of tyranny; or hail with joy and national thanksgiving the straw that offers to land them on it. Already the scientific statesman of the <LOC> age could say, casting an eye over Christendom as it stood then, 'That which most threatens us is, not an _alteration_ in the entire and solid mass, but its _dissipation_ and _divulsion_.' It is after pages of the freest philosophical discussion, that he arrives at this conclusion--discussion, in which the historical elements and powers are for the <NUM> time scientifically recognized and treated throughout with the hand of the new master.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9826446175575256,0.9826446175575256,-0.5242504477500916
328,"He wishes to reason upon it, but his mind cannot master it; under that it is that his brain gives way,--the <NUM> mental confusion begins there. The blow to his state is a subordinate thing with him. It only serves to measure the wrong that deals it. The poet takes pains to clear this complication in the experiment. It is the wound in the affections which untunes the jarring senses of 'this _child-changed father_.' It is that which invades his identity. 'Are you _our_ daughter? Does anyone here know me?' That is the word with which he breaks the silence of that dumb amazement, that paralysis of frozen wonder which <PER>'s <NUM> rude assault brings on him. 'Why, _this is not <ORG>_; Ha! sure it is not so. Does any one here know me? Who is it that can tell me _who I am_?' But with all her cruelty, he cannot shake her off. He curses her; but his curses do not sever the tie. 'But yet _thou art_ my flesh, my blood, _my daughter_. Or rather, a disease that's in my flesh Which I must needs call _mine_. Filial ingratitude! Is _it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to it_?' For that is the poet's conception of the extent of this social life and outgoing--that is the _interior_ of that social whole, in which the dissolution he represents here is proceeding,--and that is the kind of new phenomenon which the science of man, when it takes him as he is, not the abstract man of the schools, not the logical man that the <PER> and the <ORG> went to blows for, but 'the thing itself,' exhibits. As to that other '_man_,'--the man of the old <PER> was not 'worth the whistle,' this one thinks. 'His bones were marrowless, his blood was cold, he had no speculation in those eyes that he did glare with.' <ORG> will have no such skeletons in his system. He is getting his _general_ man out of particular cases, building him up solid, from a basis of natural history, and, as far as he goes, there will be no question, no <NUM> words about it, as to whether he _is_ or _is not_.

329,"In another direction you see large cases containing heaps of articles, reminding <NUM> of a shoemaker’s furnishing-store—wooden _serving-mallets, fids, toggles_, and _heavers:_ iron _prickers_ and _marling-spikes;_ in <DATE> you see a sort of hardware shop—shelves piled with all manner of hooks, bolts, nails, screws, and _thimbles;_ and, in still another direction, you see a block-maker’s store, heaped up with lignum-vitae sheeves and wheels. Through low arches in the bulkhead beyond, you peep in upon distant vaults and catacombs, obscurely lighted in the far end, and showing immense coils of new ropes, and other bulky articles, stowed in tiers, all savouring of tar. But by far the most curious department of these mysterious store-rooms is the armoury, where the spikes, cutlasses, pistols, and belts, forming the arms of the boarders in time of action, are hung against the walls, and suspended in thick rows from the beams overhead. Here, too, are to be seen scores of <ORG>’s patent revolvers, which, though furnished with but <NUM> tube, multiply the fatal bullets, as the naval cat-o’-nine-tails, with a cannibal cruelty, in <NUM> blow <NUM> times multiplies a culprit’s lashes; so that when a sailor is ordered <NUM> lashes, the sentence should read <NUM>.

He is accountable for all the articles under his charge, and on no account must deliver a yard of twine or a <MONEY> nail to the boatswain or carpenter, unless shown a written requisition and order from the Senior Lieutenant. The <PER> is to be found burrowing in his underground store-rooms all the day long, in readiness to serve licensed customers. But in the counter, behind which he usually stands, there is no place for a till to drop the shillings in, which takes away not a little from the most agreeable part of a storekeeper’s duties.

332,"Shortly after his father's death, he disappeared altogether from the vicinity; and his name became, in the course of <DATE>, an unusual sound, where once the lack of other topics of interest had given it a considerable degree of notoriety. Sometimes, however, when the <DATE> blast was loud round the lonely farm-house, its inmates remembered him who had so often chased away the gloom of <TIME>, and, though with little expectation of its fulfilment, expressed a wish to behold him again. Yet that wish, formed, perhaps, because it appeared so desperate, was finally destined to be gratified. <NUM> summer evening, <DATE> previous to the period of this tale, a man of sober and staid deportment, mounted upon a white horse, arrived at the <ORG> and <PER>, to which some civil or military meeting had chanced, <DATE>, to draw most of the inhabitants of the vicinity. The stranger was well though plainly dressed, and anywhere but in a retired country town would have attracted no particular attention; but here, where a traveller was not of <DATE> occurrence, he was soon surrounded by a little crowd, who, when his eye was averted, seized the opportunity diligently to peruse his person. He was rather a thickset man, but with no superfluous flesh; his hair was of iron-gray; he had a few wrinkles; his face was so deeply sunburnt, that, excepting a <NUM>-smothered glow on the tip of his nose, a dusky yellow was the only apparent hue. As the people gazed, it was observed that the elderly men, and the men of substance, <ORG> themselves silently to their steeds, and hied homeward with an unusual degree of haste; till at length the inn was deserted, except by a few wretched objects to whom it was a constant resort. These, instead of retreating, drew closer to the traveller, peeping anxiously into his face, and asking, ever and anon, a question, in order to discover the tone of his voice. At length, with <NUM> consent, and as if the recognition had at once burst upon them, they hailed their old boon-companion, <PER>, and, leading him into the <LOC>, did him the honor to partake of a cup of welcome at his expense.

I should think perhaps you might have remembered it.” “I hardly see why, if <PER>--a fact he plainly showed by deserting the poor creature.” The insolence of the speaker's tone was scarcely veiled. Her extreme disapproval of her father-in-law sometimes welled to the surface of her suave manner. Mr. <PER>'s thoughts had fled to <LOC>. “<PER> proposed leaving the girl here while they are gone,” he said. Mrs. <PER> straightened in her chair and her attention concentrated. “With you? What assurance! How like <PER>!” she exclaimed. The words were precisely those which her host had been saying to himself; but proceeding from her lips they had a strange effect upon him. “You find it so?” he asked. The clearer the proposition became to Mrs. <PER>'s consciousness the more she resented it. To have the child in the house not only would menace her ease and comfort, but meant a possibility that the grandfather might take an interest in <ORG>'s daughter which would disturb <PER>'s chances. “Of course it does. I call it simply presumptuous,” she declared with emphasis. “After all, <PER> has some rights,” rejoined Mr. <PER> slowly. “His wife is a dressmaker,” went on the other. “I had it directly from a <LOC> friend. <PER> has scarcely been with the child since she was born. And to saddle a little stranger like that on you! Now <PER> and _her_ father were inseparable.” There was an ominous glitter in Mr. <PER>'s eyes. “<PER>'s father!” he returned slowly. “I did not know that she remembered him.” The hurt of his tone and words sank deep into the heart of the girl, but she looked up courageously. “Your son was my father in every best sense,” she said. “We were inseparable. You must have known it.” “You appeared to be separable when your father made his visits to <ORG>,” was the rejoinder. “Pardon me if I knew very little of what took place in his household. A telegraph blank, please, Mrs. <PER>, and tell <PER> to be ready to go to the office.” There was a vital tone in the usually dry voice.

338,"He was inclined to believe, also, that a common offspring would have exerted a meliorating influence on the temper of Mrs. <PER>, the character of whose domestic government often compelled him to call to mind such portions of the wisdom of antiquity as relate to the proper endurance of the shrewishness of woman. But domestic comforts, as well as comforts of every other kind, have their drawbacks; and, so long as the balance is on the side of happiness, a wise man will not murmur. Such was the opinion of Dr. <PER>; and with a little aid from philosophy, and more from religion, he journeyed on contentedly through life. When the storm was loud by the parlor hearth, he had always a sure and quiet retreat in his study; and there, in his deep though not always useful labors, he soon forgot whatever of disagreeable nature pertained to his situation. This small and dark apartment was the only portion of the house to which, since one firmly repelled invasion, Mrs. <PER>'s omnipotence did not extend. Here (to reverse the words of <PER>) there was ""but <NUM> master and no mistress""; and that man has little right to complain who possesses so much as one corner in the world where he may be happy or miserable, as best suits him.

346,"'To thine own self be true, And it doth follow as <TIME> the day, <LOC> canst not then be false to any MAN.' 'Know thy-SELF. Know thy-self.' This enterprise was not the product of a single individual mind, and it is important that this fact should be fully and unmistakeably enunciated here; because the illustrious statesman, and man of letters, who assumed, in his own name and person, that part of it which could then be openly exhibited, the one on whom the great task of perfecting and openly propounding the new method of learning was devolved, is the one whose relation to this enterprise has been principally insisted on in this volume. The history of this great philanthropic association--an association of genius, a combination of chief minds, from which the leadership and direction of <DATE> proceeds, the history of this '_society_,' as it was called, when the term was still fresh in that special application; at least, when it was not yet qualified by its application to those very different kinds of voluntary individual combinations--'bodies of neighbourhood' within the larger whole, to which that movement has given rise; the history of _this_ society,--this first 'Shake-spear Society'--much as it is to our purpose, and much as it is to the particular purpose of this volume, can only be incidentally treated here. But as this work was originally prepared for publication in the HISTORICAL KEY to <ORG> which formed the <NUM> BOOK of it, it was the part of that great Political and Military Chief, and not less illustrious <ORG>, who was recognised, in his own time, as the beginner of this movement and the founder of English philosophy, which was chiefly developed. And it is the history of that 'great unknown'--that great Elizabethan unknown, for whose designs there was needed then a veil of a closer texture--of a more cunning pattern than any which the exigencies of modern authorship tend to fabricate, which must make the key to this tradition;--it is the history of that great unknown, whose <PER> was a closed vizor,--that it was death to open,--a vizor that _did_ open once, and--the sequel is in our history, and will leave 'a brand' upon the page which that age makes in it,--'the age that _did_ it, and _suffered_ it, _to the end of the world_.'

347,"And after glancing at the specific subject of remedial agencies which _are_ within the scope of our revision and renovation, under some other heads, concluding with that which is of all others the most compendious and summary, and again the most noble and effectual to the reducing of the mind unto virtue and good estate, he concludes this whole part, this part in which the points and outlines of the new science--that radical human science which he has dared to report deficient, come out with such masterly grasp and <PER> concludes this _whole part_ in the words which follow,--words which it will take the author's own doctrine of interpretation to open. For this is one of those passages which he commends to the <NUM> cogitation of the reader, and he knew if 'the times that were nearer' were not able to read it, 'the times that were farther off' would find it clear enough. 'Therefore I do conclude this part of Moral _Knowledge_ concerning the culture and regiment of the Mind; wherein if any man, _considering the facts thereof which I have enumerated_, do judge that _my labour is_ to COLLECT INTO AN ART OR SCIENCE, that which hath been _pretermitted by others_, as matters of common sense and experience, he judgeth well.' The practised eye will detect on the surface here, some marks of that style which this author recommends in such cases: especially where such strong pre-occupations exist; already we perceive that this is one of those sentences which is addressed to the skill of the interpreter; in which, by means of a careful selection and collocation of words, <NUM> or more meanings are conveyed under one form of expression. And it may not be amiss to remember here, that this is a style, according to the author's own description of it elsewhere, in which the more involved and enigmatical passages sometimes admit of _several_ readings, each having its own pertinence and value, according to the mental condition of the reader; and that it is a style in which even the _delicate, collateral sounds_, that are distinctly included in this art of tradition, must come in sometimes in the more critical places, in aid of the interpretation. 'But what if it be an harangue whereon his life depends?' l.--If any man considering the parts thereof, which I have enumerated, do judge that MY LABOUR IS to _collect into an_ ART or SCIENCE that which hath been PRETER-MITTED by others, _he_ judgeth well. <NUM> any man do judge that my labour is to collect into an ART or SCIENCE that which hath been pretermitted by others AS MATTERS OF COMMON SENSE and EXPERIENCE, _he_ judgeth well.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9829534292221069,0.9829534292221069,-0.5696900486946106
348,"'Neither these stories,' he says, 'nor my allegations do always serve simply for example, authority, or ornament; I do not only regard them for the use I make of them; they carry sometimes, _besides what I apply them to_, the seeds of a richer and bolder matter, and sometimes, _collaterally, a more delicate sound_, both to me myself,--who will say no more about it _in this place_' [we shall hear more of it in another place, however, and where the delicate collateral sounds will not be wanting]--'both to me myself, and _to others who happen to be of my ear_.' To the reader, who does indeed happen to be of his ear, to one who has read the 'allegations' and stories that he speaks of, and the whole work, and the works connected with it, by means of that knowledge of the inner intention, and of the method to which he alludes, this passage would of course convey no new intelligence. But will the reader, to whom the views here presented are yet too new to seem credible, endeavour to imagine or invent for himself any form of words, in which the claim already made in regard to the style in which the great original writers of this age and the founders of the new science of the human life were compelled to infold their doctrine, could have been, in the case of this one at least, more distinctly asserted. Here is proof that <NUM> of them, one who counted on an _audience_ too, did find himself compelled to infold his richer and bolder meanings in the manner described. All that need be claimed at present in regard to the authorship of this sentence is, that it is written by <NUM> whose writings, in their higher intention, have ceased to be understood, for lack of the '_ear_' to which his bolder and richer meanings are addressed, for lack of the _ear_, to which the collateral and more delicate sounds which his words sometimes carry with them are perceptible; and that it is written by a philosopher whose learning and aims and opinions, down to the slightest points of detail, are absolutely identical with those of the principal writers of this school. But let us look at a few of the stories which he ventures to introduce so emphatically, selecting only such as can be told in a sentence or <NUM>. Let us take the next one that follows this explanation--the story in the very next paragraph to it. The question is _apparently_ of <ORG>, of his style, of his vanity, of his supposed care for his _fame_ in <DATE>, of his _real disposition and objects_.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9853543043136597,0.9853543043136597,-0.3366504907608032

There is a great deal of fictitious correspondence here, designed to eke out that view of this author's life and times which the authentic letters left unfinished, and which he was anxious, for certain reasons, to transmit to posterity,--which he was forbidden to transmit in a more direct manner. There is a good deal of miscellaneous letter-writing here, and there will be found whole series of letters, in which the correspondence is sustained on both sides in a tolerably lively manner, by <ORG>; but under a very meagre dramatic cover in this case, designedly thin, never meant to serve as a cover with 'men of understanding.'

368,"The way to steer clear of those empty and barren generalities, which do but offer learning to the scorn of the men of practice is, he says, to begin on the practical side, and that is just what we are doing here now in this question of the consulship,--that so practical and immediately urgent question which was, threatening then to drive out every other from the human consideration. If learning _had_ anything to offer on that subject, which would _not_ excite the scorn of practical men, then certainly was the time to produce it. We begin on the practical side here, and as to theory, we are rigidly limited to that which the question of the play requires,--the practical question marks it out,--we have just as much as is required for the solution of that, and not so much as a 'jot' more.

The scorn of practical men is avoided, if it were only by its want of pretension; and the fact that it does not offer itself as a guide to practice, but rather insinuates itself into that position. We begin with the practical question, with its most sharply practical details, we begin with particulars, but that which is to be noted is, 'the foundations' of the universal philosophy are under our feet to begin with. At the <NUM> step we are on the platform of the prima philosophia; the last conclusions of the inductive science, the knowledge of the nature of things, is the ground,--the solid continuity--that we proceed on. That is the ground on which we build this practice. That is the trunk from which this branch of sciences is continued:--that trunk of universality which we are forbidden henceforth to _scorn_, because all the professions are nourished from it. That universality which the men of practice scorn no more, since they have tasted of its proofs, since they have reached that single bough of it, which stooped so low, to bring its magic clusters within their reach.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9701665639877319,0.9701665639877319,-1.0956496000289917

Religion is--a--too personal a matter to be mentioned in such a place.” “Is it?” answered the Highlander, “then what did those policemen swear by just now?” “That is no parallel,” answered <ORG>, rather irritably; “of course there is a form of oath--to be taken reverently--reverently, and there's an end of it.

But now""--He would have proceeded; but the firmness which had hitherto sustained him gave way. He turned aside to hide the tears which all the pride of his nature could not restrain, and which, instead of relieving, added to his anguish.

He had exerted the whole might of his spirit over itself, and he was a conqueror. Perhaps, indeed, a summer breeze of sad and gentle thoughts would sometimes visit him; but, in these brief memories of his love, he did not wish that it should be revived, or mourn over its event. There were many who felt an interest in <PER>; but the influence of none could prevail upon him to lay aside the habits, mental and physical, by which he was bringing himself to the grave. His passage thither was consequently rapid, terminating just as he reached his <DATE>.

382,"Above, we see an intimation, that the divisions of the subject are, after all, not so 'curious' but that the inquiry might possibly be resumed again in other connections, and in the particular connection specified, namely, in that part which concerneth _Policy_. In that which follows, the new science of human nature and human life--which is the end and term of this treatise, we are told--is brought out under the <NUM> heads of <ORG>; and it is necessary to look into _both_ these departments in order to find what application he was proposing to make of this art and science of Tradition and Delivery, and in order to see what place--what vital place it occupied in his system. CHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF POLICY. 'Policy is the most immersed.' --_Advancement of Learning_. Reversing the philosophic order, we glance <NUM> into that new department of science which the author is here boldly undertaking to constitute under the above name, because in this his own practical designs, and rules of proceeding, are more clearly laid open, and the place which is assigned in his system to that radical science, for which these arts of Delivery and Tradition are chiefly wanting, is distinctly pointed out. And, moreover, in this department of Policy itself, in marking out <NUM> of the grand divisions of it, we find him particularly noticing, and openly insisting on, the form of delivery and inculcation which the new science must take here, that is, if it is going to be at all available as a science of practice. In this so-called plan for the advancement of learning, the author proceeds, as we all know, by noticing _the deficiencies_ in human learning as he finds it; and everywhere it is that radical deficiency, which leaves human life and human conduct in the dark, while the philosophers are busied with their controversies and wordy speculations. And in that part of his inventory where he puts down as wanting a science of practice in those <DATE> affairs and incidents, in which the life of man is most conversant, embodying axioms of practice that shall save men the wretched mistakes and blunders of which the individual life is so largely made up; blunders which are inevitable, so long as men are left here, to natural human ignorance, to uncollected individual experience, or to the shrewdest empiricism;--in this so original and interesting part of the work, he takes pains to tell us at length, that that which he has before put down under the head of '_delivery_' as a point of form and method, becomes here essential as a point of substance also.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9847393035888672,0.9847393035888672,-0.3887762129306793

It is play, but let us thank God it is no such play as that; let our common human nature rejoice that it has not been thus outraged in its chief and chosen one, that it has not been thus disgraced with the boundless human worthlessness of the creature on whom its choicest gifts were lavished.

The generalizations of the higher stages of philosophy--the axioms of a universal philosophy--with all the force of their universality, must be brought to bear upon it, through all its developments.

He was a tall, resolute fellow, who had once been a brakeman on a railroad, and he kept us all pretty straight; from his fiat there was no appeal.

Yes, that is the position; and not taken in the general only, for he will proceed to propound it with more particularity--he will give us the HEADS of it--he will proceed to the articulation of that which is wanting--he will put down, before our eyes, the points and outlines of the new human science, the science of the husbandry thereto, both for the worthiness thereof, and that it may appear the better WHAT IT IS, and whether--WHETHER IT BE EXTANT. For who knows but it may be? Who knows, after all, but the points and outlines here, may prove but the track of that argument which the new Georgics will be able to hide in the play of their illustration, as Periander hid his? Who knows but the Naturalist in this field was then already on the ground, making his collections? Who knows but this new <PER>, who thought little of that resplendent and lustrous mass of matter, that old poets had taken for their glory, who seized the common life of men, and not the ideal life only, for his theme--who made the relief of the human estate, and not glory, his end, but knew that he might promise himself a fame which would make the old heroic poets' crowns grow dim,--who knows but that _he_--he himself--is extant, contemplating his theme, and composing its Index--claiming as yet its INDEX only? Truly, if the propounder of this argument can in any measure supply the _defects_ which he outlines, and opens here,--if he can point out to us any new and worthy collections in that science for which he claims to break the ground--if he can, in any measure, constitute it, he will deserve that name which he aspired to, and for which he was willing to renounce his own, 'Benefactor of men,' and not of an age or nation. But let us see where this new science, and scientific art of human culture begins,--this science and art which is to differ from those which have preceded it, as the other Baconian arts and sciences which began in the new doctrine of nature, differed from those which preceded them.

How happens it? Did he get so occupied with the question of _heat_ and _cold_, _light_ and vegetation, and _the like_, that after all he forgot this part with its nobler applications? How could that be, when he tells us expressly, that they are the more chosen subjects of his inquiry. This part which he speaks of here, is the missing part of his philosophy, unquestionably. These are the books of it which have been missing hitherto; but in that <ORG> order of events to which he refers himself, the time has come for them to be inquired for; and this inquiry is itself a part of that movement, in which the smallest beginnings lead assuredly to some result. For, 'let us begin from God,' he says, 'and show that our pursuit, from its exceeding goodness, clearly proceeds from Him, the Author of GOOD, and not of misery; the Father of LIGHT, and not of darkness.' Of course, it was impossible to get out any scientific doctrine of the human society, without coming at once in collision with that doctrine of the divinity of arbitrary power which the monarchs of <LOC> were then openly sustaining. Who needs to be told, that he who would handle that argument scientifically, then, without military weapons, as this inquirer _would_, must indeed 'pray in aid of _similes_.' And yet a very searching and critical inquiry into the claims of that institution, which the new philosophy found in possession of the human welfare, and asserting a divine right to it as a thing of private property and legitimate family inheritance,--such a criticism was, in fact, inevitably involved in that inquiry into the principles of a _human_ subjection which appeared to this philosopher to belong properly to the more chosen subjects of a scientific investigation.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9800766110420227,0.9800766110420227,-0.5886803269386292

If anything is going on in any of its departments which he judges to be detrimental to the healthfulness of the crew, he has a right to protest against it formally to the Captain.

It is one of the earliest indications of the revival, in the heart of Romanticism, of the old love of classical myths and classical beauty. The subject is a wide one, and cannot be adequately dealt with in this place. But a few words may not be superfluous for a correct historical appreciation of Mrs. <PER>’s attempt. How deficient had been the sense of classical beauty in the so-called classical age of English literature, is a trite consideration of criticism. The treatment of mythology is particularly conclusive on this point. Throughout the ‘Augustan’ era, mythology was approached as a mere treasure-house of pleasant fancies, artificial decorations, ‘motives’, whether sumptuous or meretricious. Allusions to <PER> and <LOC>, <ORG>, <ORG>, or <PER>, are of course found in every other page of <LOC>, Pope, Prior, <ORG>, <ORG>, and <PER>.

He was tall; and the natural grace of his manners had been improved (an advantage which few of his associates could boast) by early intercourse with polished society. His features, also, were handsome, and promised to be manly and dignified when they should cease to be youthful. His character as a scholar was more than respectable, though many youthful follies, sometimes, perhaps, approaching near to vices, were laid to his charge. But his occasional derelictions from discipline were not such as to create any very serious apprehensions respecting his future welfare; nor were they greater than, perhaps, might be expected from a young man who possessed a considerable command of money, and who was, besides, the fine gentleman of the little community of which he was a member,--a character which generally leads its possessor into follies that he would otherwise have avoided.

432,"There is a very bold artist here already, with all his deference for the antique. We shall be sure to have _all_ when he is the plotter. The action of this drama is not complicated. The persons of it are few; the characterization is feeble, compared with that of some of the later plays; but that does not hinder or limit the design, and it is all the more apparent for this artistic poverty, anatomically clear; while as yet that perfection of art in which all trace of the structure came so soon to be lost in the beauty of the illustration, is yet wanting; while as yet that art which made of its living instance an intenser life, or which made with its _living_ art a life more living than life itself, was only germinating. The illustration here, indeed, approaches the allegorical form, in the obtrusive, untempered predominance of the qualities represented, so overdone as to wear the air of a caricature, though the historical combination is still here. These diagrams are alive evidently; they are men, and not allegorical spectres, or toys, though they are 'painted in character.' The entire representation of the extant learning is dramatically produced on this stage; the germ of the 'new' is here also; and the unoccupied ground of it is marked out here as, in <ORG>, by the criticism on the deficiences of that which has the field. Here, too, the line of the extant culture,--the narrow indented boundary of the _culture_ that professed to take all is always defining the new,--cutting out the wild not yet visited by the art of man;--only here the criticism is much more lively, because here 'we come _to particulars_,' a thing which the new philosophy--much insists on; and though this want in learning, and the wildness it leaves, is that which makes tragedies in this method of exhibition; it has its comical aspect also; and this is the laughing and weeping philosopher in one who manages these representations; and in this case it is the comical aspect of the subject that is seized on.

But we have enough to understand the general trend of the argument. It did not actually intend to sap the foundations of Scriptural authority. But it was bold enough to risk a little shaking in order to prove that the Sacred Books of the Greeks and Romans did not, after all, present us with a much more rickety structure. This was a task of conciliation rather than destruction. And yet even this conservative view of the Shelleys’ exegesis cannot—and will not—detract from the value of the above document.

434,"Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must <NUM> have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend <DATE> and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret. Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true.

440,"It will not have abstract revolutionists, any more than it will have abstract butterflies, or bivalves, or univalves. This is the kind of 'loud' talk that one is apt to hear in this man's school; and the clash and clang that this very play now under review is full of, is just the noise that is sure to come out of his laboratory, whenever he gets upon one of these experiments in 'extensive wholes,' which he is so fond of trying. It is the noise that one always hears on his stage, whenever the question of 'particular forms' and _predominance of powers comes_ to be put experimentally, at least, _in this class_ of 'wrestling instances.' For we have here a form of composition in which that more simple and natural order above referred to is adopted--where those clear scientific classifications, which this author himself plainly exhibits in another scientific work, though he disguises them in the Novum Organum, are again brought out, no longer in the abstract, but grappling the matter; where, instead of the scientific technicalities just quoted--instead of those abstract terms, such as 'extensive wholes,' 'greater congregation,' 'fruition of their natures,' and the like--we have terms not less scientific, the equivalents of these, but more living--words ringing with the detail of life in its scientific condensations--reddening with the glow, or whitening with the calm, of its ideal intensities--pursuing it everywhere--everywhere, to the last height of its poetic fervors and exaltations. And it is because this so vivid popular science has its issue from this 'source'--it is because it proceeds from this scientific centre, on the scientific radii, through all the divergencies and refrangibilities of the universal beam--it is because all this inexhaustible multiplicity and variety of particulars is threaded with the fibre of the universal science--it is because all these thick-flowering imaginations, these 'mellow hangings,' are hung upon the stems and branches that unite in the trunk of the _prima philosophia_--it is because of this that men find it so prophetic, so inclusive, so magical; _this_ is the reason they find _all_ in it. 'I have either told, or designed to tell, _all_,' says the expositor of these plays. 'What I cannot speak, I point out with my finger.'

446,"As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head. Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, <DATE> after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer. The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.” “I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation. The magistrate appeared at <NUM> perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance. When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.” This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor.

But passive good includes both conservation and perfection, or _advancement_, which latter is the highest degree of passive good. For to preserve in state is the less; to preserve with advancement is the greater. As to _man_, his approach or assumption to DIVINE or ANGELICAL NATURE is the perfection of _his_ form, the error or false imitation of which good is that which is the tempest of human life.

And having deduced 'that good of man which is private and particular, as far as seemeth fit,' he returns 'to that good of man which respects and beholds society,' which he terms DUTY, because the term of duty is more proper to a mind well framed and disposed towards others, as the term of VIRTUE is applied to a mind well formed and composed in itself; though neither can a man understand _virtue, without some relation to society_, nor _duty, without an inward disposition_. But he wishes us to understand and remember, now that he comes out of the particular nature, and begins to look towards society with this term of Duty, that he is still dealing with 'the will of particular persons,' that it is still the science of _morals_, and not _politics_, that he is meddling with. 'This part may seem at <NUM>,' he says, 'to pertain to science civil and politic, but not if it be well observed; for it concerneth the regiment and _government of every man over himself_, and not over others.' And this is the plan which he has marked out in his doctrine of government as the most hopeful point in which to _commence_ political reformations; and one cannot but observe, that if this art and science should be successfully cultivated, the one which he dismisses so briefly would be cleared at once of some of those difficulties, which rendered any more direct treatment of it at that time unadvisable.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9156957268714905,0.9156957268714905,-2.465498924255371

461,"But that the Poet should have dared to think of exhibiting it dramatically in this instance, and that, too, in its most hopeless form--that he should have dared to think of exhibiting the personality which was then 'the state' to the eye of 'the subject' labouring under that personal disability, in the very act, too, of boasting of its kingly terrors--this only goes to show what large prerogatives, what boundless freedoms and immunities, the resources of this particular department of art could be made to yield, when it fell into the hands of the new <ORG>, when it came to be selected by the Art-king himself as his instrument. But we are prepared for this spectacle, and with the Poet's wonted skill; for it is _<PER>_, her heart bursting with its stormy passion of filial love and grief, that, REBEL-LIKE, seeks to be QUEEN o'er her, though she queens it still, and 'the smiles on her ripe lips seem not to know what tears are in her eyes,' for she has had <TIME> with her subject grief, and 'dealt with it alone,'--it is this child of truth and duty, this true <PER>, this impersonated sovereignty, whom her Poet crowns with his choicest graces, on whom he devolves the task of prefacing this so critical, and, one might think, perhaps, perilous exhibition. But her description does not disguise the matter, or palliate its extremity. 'Why, he was met even now, Mad as the _vexed sea_, singing aloud;' _Crowned_--. 'Crowned with _rank fumiter_, and _furrow weeds_, With hardocks, _hemlock_, _nettles_, cuckow flowers, _<ORG>, and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn_.' That is the crown; and a very extraordinary symbol of sovereignty it is, one cannot help thinking, for the divine right to get on its head by any accident just then. Surely that symbol of power is getting somewhat rudely handled here, in the course of the movements which the 'necessary questions of this Play' involve, as the critical mind might begin to think. In the botanical analysis of that then so dazzling, and potent, and compelling instrument in human affairs, a very careful observer might perhaps take notice that the decidedly hurtful and noxious influences in nature appear to have a prominent place; and, for the rest, that the qualities of _wildness_ and idleness, and encroaching good-for-nothingness, appear to be the common and predominating elements. It is when the Tragedy reaches its height that this _crown_ comes out.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.7708970308303833,0.7708970308303833,-3.6070754528045654

And then lifted suddenly a face that looked fresh and young, as if he had dipped and washed it in some holy well. “Very well,” he cried; “I will take the sour with the sweet.

If we would know the secret of those struggles, those hard conflicts that were going on here then, in whose results all the future ages of mankind were concerned, we must penetrate with this Poet the secret of the Roman patrician's house; we must listen, through that thin poetic barrier, to the great chief himself, the chief of the unborn age of a new civilization--the leader, and hero, and conqueror of <DATE>--as he enters and paces his own hall, with the angry fire in his eyes, and utters there the words for which there is no utterance without--as he listens there anew to the argument of that for which he lives, and seeks to reconcile himself anew to that baseness which his time demands of him.

Remembering the feverish child of <TIME>, he looked at her in silent wonder. The appearance of her flaxen head he could see was in contrast to the trim and well-cared-for look it had worn when she arrived. “Poor little thing!” he thought. “She looks motherless--motherless.” Involuntarily he cast a glance of impatience at his other guests.

467,"Whereas, in port, unless some particular service engages them, they lead the laziest of lives, beset by all the allurements of the shore, though perhaps that shore they may never touch. Unless you happen to belong to one of the numerous boats, which, in a man-of-war in harbour, are continually plying to and from the land, you are mostly thrown upon your own resources to while away the time. <DATE> frequently pass without your being individually called upon to lift a finger; for though, in the merchant-service, they make a point of keeping the men always busy about something or other, yet, to employ <NUM> sailors when there is nothing definite to be done wholly surpasses the ingenuity of any First Lieutenant in the <ORG>. As mention has just been made of the numerous boats employed in harbour, something more may as well be put down concerning them. Our frigate carried a very large boat—as big as a small sloop—called a _launch_, which was generally used for getting off wood, water, and other bulky articles. Besides this, she carried <NUM> boats of an arithmetical progression in point of size—the largest being known as the <NUM> cutter, the next largest the <NUM> cutter, then the <NUM> and <NUM> cutters. She also carried a Commodore’s Barge, a Captain’s Gig, and a “dingy,” a small yawl, with a crew of apprentice boys. All these boats, except the “dingy,” had their regular crews, who were subordinate to their <PER> officers_, receiving pay in addition to their seaman’s wages. The _launch_ was manned by the old Tritons of the forecastle, who were no ways particular about their dress, while the other boats—commissioned for genteeler duties—were rowed by young follows, mostly, who had a dandy eye to their personal appearance. Above all, the officers see to it that the <PER>’s Barge and the Captain’s Gig are manned by gentlemanly youths, who may do credit to their country, and form agreeable objects for the eyes of the <PER> or Captain to repose upon as he tranquilly sits in the stern, when pulled ashore by his barge-men or gig-men, as the case may be. Some sailors are very fond of belonging to the boats, and deem it a great honour to be a _<PER>’s barge-man_; but others, perceiving no particular distinction in that office, do not court it so much.

With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on <NUM> of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.

It was <TIME> in which the genius of antiquity was reviving; it was <TIME> in which the poetic inspiration of <DATE> was reviving, and _arming_ itself with the knowledge of 'things not dreamt of' by old reformers--that knowledge of nature which is _power_, which is the true _magic_. For this new Poet had seen in a vision that same 'excellent beauty' which 'the divine' ones saw of old, and 'the New Atlantis,' the celestial vision of _her_ kingdom; and being also 'ravished with that excellence, and _awakening_, he determined to _seek her out_. And so being by _<PER> armed_, and by _<PER> thoroughly instructed_, he went forth to seek her in _Fairy Land_.'

There is no knowing what would have ensued, had not the bass drum suddenly been heard, calling all hands to quarters, a summons not to be withstood. The sailors pricked their ears at it, as horses at the sound of a cracking whip, and confusedly stumbled up the ladders to their stations. The next moment all was silent but the wind, howling like a thousand devils in the cordage. “Stand by to reef all <NUM> top-sails!—settle away the halyards!—haul out—so: make fast!—aloft, top-men! and reef away!” Thus, in storm and tempest terminated that <DATE>’s theatricals.

488,"If a musket be charged with ball and powdered sulphur only, and the fire be applied, the ball is not discharged, in which case the motion of greater congregation overcomes that of matter; but when gunpowder is used, the motion of matter in the sulphur _predominates_, being _assisted_ by that motion, and the motion of avoidance in the nitre; and _so of the rest_.' Our more recent chemists would, of course, be inclined to criticise that explanation; but, in some respects, it is better than theirs; and it answers well enough the purpose for which it was introduced there, and for which it is introduced here also. For this is the initiative of the great inquiry into 'the WRESTLING INSTANCES,' and the 'instances of PREDOMINANCE' in general, 'such as point out the predominance of _powers, compared with each other_, and which of them is _the more energetic and_ SUPERIOR, or more _weak_ and INFERIOR'; and though this class of instances is valued chiefly for its illustration of another in this system of learning, where things are valued in proportion to their usefulness, they are not sought for as similitudes merely; they are produced by one who regards them as 'the same footsteps of nature, treading in different substances,' and leaving the foot-print of universal axioms; and this is a _class_ of instances which he particularly recommends to inquiry. 'For wrestling instances, which show _the predominance of powers_, and in _what manner_ and _proportion_ they predominate and yield, must be searched for with active and industrious diligence.' 'The _method and nature_ of this yielding' [of _this yielding_--SUBJECTION is the question] 'must also be diligently examined; as, _for instance_, whether the motions' 'completely cease, or exert themselves, but are constrained; for in all bodies with which we are acquainted, _there is no real, but an apparent rest, either in the whole, or in the parts_. This apparent rest is occasioned either by equilibrium' [as in the case of Hamlet, as well as in that of some others whose acts were suspended, and whose wills were arrested then, by considerations not less comprehensive than his]--'either by equilibrium, _or by the absolute predominance_ of motions. By equilibrium, as in the scales of the balance, which _rest if the weight be equal_. By predominance, as in perforated jars, in which the water rests, and is prevented from falling by the predominance of the motion of CONNECTION.'

But in that great practical enterprise of a social and political renovation--that enterprise of 'constructions' according to true definitions, which this science fastens its eye on, and never ceases to contemplate--it was not the immediate effect on the popular mind, neither was it the gradual effect on the speculative habits of men of learning and men of intelligence in general, that was chiefly relied on.

511,"'Better travels, I suppose, had the Stoics taken in this argument, as far as I can gather by that which we have at secondhand. _But yet_ it is like it was after their manner, rather in subtlety of definitions, which, in a subject of this nature, are _but curiosities_, than _in_ ACTIVE _and_ AMPLE DESCRIPTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS. So, likewise, I find some particular writings of _an elegant nature_, touching some of the affections; as of anger, of comfort upon adverse accidents, of tenderness of countenance, and others.' And such writings were not confined to the ancients. Some of us have seen elegant writings of this nature, published under the name of the philosopher who composes this criticism, and suggests the possibility of essays of a more lively and _experimental_ kind, and who seems to think that the treatment should be _ample_, as well as _active_. '_But_ the POETS and WRITERS of HISTORY are the best _Doctors_ of _this knowledge_, where we may find, painted forth with great _life_, _how affections are kindled and incited_, and _how pacified_ and _refrained_;'--certainly, that is the kind of learning we want here:--'and how, again, contained from _act_ and _further degree_'--very useful knowledge, one would say, and it is a pity it should not be 'diffused,' but it is not every poet who can be said to have it;--'_how_ they disclose themselves--_how_ they work--how they vary;'--this is the science of them clearly, _whoever_ has it;--'how they gather and fortify--how they are _enwrapped <NUM> within <ORG>, there is one Poet, <NUM> Doctor of this science, in whom we can find _that_ also;--'and how they do fight and encounter one with another, and other like _particularities_.' We all know what Poet it is, to whose lively and ample descriptions of the affections and passions--to whose _particularities_--that description best applies, and in what age of the world he lived; but no one, who has not <NUM> studied them as scientific exhibitions, can begin to perceive the force--the exclusive force--of the reference. 'Amongst the which, this last is of special _use_ in MORAL and CIVIL matters: _how_, I say, to _set affection against affection_, and to master one by another, even as we used to hunt beast with beast, and fly bird with bird, which otherwise, percase, we could not so easily recover.'",unknown,JaneAusten,0.9170986413955688,0.9170986413955688,-6.309737682342529
512,"I will have the subject newly writ over, _that I may example my digression by some mighty precedent_. _Love's Labour's Lost._ But the king's philosophical studies are not yet completed; for he is in the hands of one who does not rely on general statements for his effects; one who is pertinaciously bent on exploring those subterranean social depths, that the king's prayer has just glanced at--who is determined to lay bare to the utmost, to carry the torch of his new science into the lowest recess of that wild, nameless mass of human neglect and misery, which the regal sympathy has embraced for him in the general; though not, indeed, without some niceties of detail, which shew that the eye of a true human pity has collected the terms in which he expresses it. That vast, immeasurable mass of social misery, which has no learned speech, no tragic dialect--no, or 'it would bear such an emphasis,' that 'its phrase of sorrow might conjure the wandering stars, and bid them stand like wonder-wounded hearers'--that misery which must get a king's robe about it, ere, in the Poet's time, it could have an audience, must needs be produced here, ere all this play was played, in its own native and proper shape and costume, daring as the attempt might seem. The author is not satisfied with the picturesque details of that misery which he has already given us, with its 'looped and windowed raggedness,' its 'houseless head,' its 'unfed sides'; it must be yet more palpably presented. It must be embodied and dramatically developed; it must be exhibited with its proper moral and intellectual accompaniments, too, before the philosophic requisitions of this design can be fulfilled. To the lowest <PER> of the lowest depths of the unfathomed social misery of that time, the new philosopher, the Poet of <ORG>, will himself descend; and drag up to the eye of day,--undeterred by any scruple of poetic sensibility,--in his own unborrowed habiliments, with all the badges of _his_ position in the state upon him, the creature he has selected as one of the representatives of the social state as he finds it;--the creature he has selected as the representative of those loathsome, unpenetrated masses of _human_ life, which the unscientific social state must needs generate.

It is the providential order of the world's history which is revealed in it; it is the fulfilment of ancient prophecy which this new chief, laden with new gifts for men, openly announces. 'Let us begin from God,' he says, when he begins to open his ground of _hope_, after he has exposed the wretched condition of men as he finds them, without any scientific knowledge of the laws and institutes of the universe they inhabit, engaged in a perpetual and mad collision with them; 'Let us begin from God, and show that our pursuit, from its exceeding goodness, _clearly_ proceeds from Him, the Author of GOOD and Father of LIGHT.

519,"The motor-car, when he was not looking at it, gave him a rude impression of a captured coach in <DATE> of highwaymen. And he whose whole soul was with the swords and stately manners of <DATE>, he who was a Jacobite risen from the dead, had an overwhelming sense of being once more in the picture, when he had so long been out of the picture. In that short and strong silence he absorbed the lady from head to foot. He had never really looked at a human being before in his life. He saw her face and hair <NUM>, then that she had long suede gloves; then that there was a fur cap at the back of her brown hair. He might, perhaps, be excused for this hungry attention.

522,"It was a very narrow line that the policy which was to save the state had to keep to then. There were evils on both sides. But to the scientific mind there appeared to be a choice in them. The measure on <NUM> side had been taken, and it was in all men's hearts, but the abysses on the other no man had sounded. 'The danger of stirring things,'--the dangers, too, of that unscanned swiftness that too late _ties leaden pounds to his heels_ were the dangers that were always threatening the Elizabethan movement, and defining and curbing it. The wisest men of that time leaned towards the monarchy, the monarchy that was, rather than the anarchy that was threatening them.

To effect the change which the time required without 'wrenching all'--without undoing the work of ages--without setting at large from the restraints of reverence and custom the chained tiger of an unenlightened popular will, this was the problem.

We must not quarrel with their concessions to tyranny on the one hand, nor with their determination to effect changes on the other, until we are able to command entirely the position they occupied, and the opposing dangers they had always to consider. We must not judge them till they have had their hearing. What freedom and what hope there is of it upon the earth to-day, is the legacy of their perseverance and endurance. They experienced many defeats. The hopes of youth, the hopes of manhood in turn grew cold. That the 'glorious day' which 'flattered the mountain tops' of their immortal morning with its sovereign eye would never shine on them; that their own, with all its unimagined splendours obscured so long, would go down hid in those same 'base clouds,' that for them the consummation was to 'peep about to find themselves dishonourable graves' was the conviction under which their later tasks were achieved. It did not abate their ardour. They did not strain one nerve the less for that. Driven from <NUM> field, they showed themselves in another. Driven from the open field, they fought in secret.

These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.

536,"It was necessary to exhibit the whole misery, the last extreme of that social evil, to which a creature so naturally frail and ignorant is liable, under those coarse, fortuitous, inartistic, unscientific social conglomerations, which ignorant and barbarous ages build, and under the tyranny of those wild, barbaric social evils, which our fine social institutions, notwithstanding the universality of their terms, and the transcendant nature of the forces which they are understood to have at their disposal, for some fatal reason or other, do not yet succeed in reducing. It is, indeed, the whole ground of the Scientific Human Art, which is revealed here by the light of this great passion, and that, in this Poet's opinion, is none other than the ground of the human want, and is as large and various as that.

This female, notwithstanding her years, and the habitual fretfulness (that is more wearing than time), was apparently healthy and robust, with a dry, leathery complexion.

542,"More than once I have known him, when going forward to the <PER>, pick his way carefully among scores of canvas checker-cloths spread upon the deck, so as not to tread upon the men—the checker-men and man-of-war’s-men included; but, in a certain sense, they were both one; for, as the sailors used their checker-men, so, at quarters, their officers used these man-of-war’s men. But Captain <PER>’s leniency in permitting checkers on board his ship might have arisen from the following little circumstance, confidentially communicated to me. Soon after the ship had sailed from home, checkers were prohibited; whereupon the sailors were exasperated against the Captain, and <TIME>, when he was walking round the <PER>, bim! came an iron belaying-pin past his ears; and while he was dodging that, bim! came another, from the other side; so that, it being a very dark night, and nobody to be seen, and it being impossible to find out the trespassers, he thought it best to get back into his cabin as soon as possible. Some time after—just as if the belaying-pins had nothing to do with it—it was indirectly rumoured that the checker-boards might be brought out again, which—as a philosophical shipmate observed—showed that Captain <PER> was a man of a ready understanding, and could understand a hint as well as any other man, even when conveyed by several pounds of iron. Some of the sailors were very precise about their checker-cloths, and even went so far that they would not let you play with them unless you <NUM> washed your hands, especially if so be you had just come from tarring down the rigging. Another way of beguiling <TIME>, is to get a cosy seat somewhere, and fall into as snug a little reverie as you can. Or if a seat is not to be had—which is frequently the case—then get a tolerably comfortable _stand-up_ against the bulwarks, and begin to think about home and bread and butter—always inseparably connected to a wanderer—which will very soon bring delicious tears into your eyes; for every one knows what a luxury is grief, when you can get a private closet to enjoy it in, and no <PER> intrude.

544,"The spectacle of a people violently '_revoking_ their _ignorant election_,' and empirically seeking to better their state under such leaders as such a movement was likely to throw up, and that, too, when the _old_ military government was still so strong in moral forces, so sure of a faction in the state--of a faction of the best, which would cleave the state to the centre, which would resist with the zealot's fire unto blood and desperation the _unholy_ innovation--that would stand on the last plank of the wrecked order, and wade through seas of slaughter to restore it; the prospect of untried political innovation, under such circumstances, did _not_ present itself to this Poet's imagination in a form so absolutely alluring, as it might have done to a philosopher of a less rigidly _inductive_, turn of mind. His canvas, with its magic draught of the coming event, includes already some contingencies which the programme of the theoretical speculator in revolutions would have been far enough from including _then_, when such movements were yet untried in modern history, and the philosopher had to go back to mythical <LOC> to borrow an historical frame of one that would contain his piece. The conviction that the crash was, perhaps, inevitable, that the overthrow of the existing usurpation, and the restoration of the English subject to his rights,--a movement then already determined on,--would perhaps involve these so tragic consequences--the conviction that the revolution was at hand, was the conviction with which he made his arrangements for the future. But if any one would like to see now for himself what vigorous grasp of particulars this inductive science of state involves, what a clear, comprehensive, and masterly basis of history it rests on, and how totally unlike the philosophy of prenotions it is in this respect--if one would see what breadth of revolutionary surges this Artist of the peace principles was able to span with his arches and sleepers, what upheavings from the then unsounded depths of political contingencies, what upliftings from the last depths of the revolutionary abysses, this science of _stability_, this science of the future STATE, is settled on,--such a one must explore this work yet further, and be able to find and unroll in it that revolutionary picture which it contains--that scientific exhibition which the <LOC> statesman has contrived to fold in it of a state in which the elements are already cleaving and separating, one in which the historical solidities are already in solution, or struggling towards it--prematurely, perhaps, and in danger of being surprised and overtaken by new combinations, not less oppressive and unscientific than the old.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9275604486465454,0.9275604486465454,-2.3766729831695557
546,"Chapter 24 My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion. My <NUM> resolution was to quit <LOC> for ever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed. And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being. When I quitted <LOC> my <NUM> labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many <TIME> round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where <PER>, <PER>, and my father reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; <TIME> was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner. The deep grief which this scene had at <NUM> excited quickly gave way to rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9848346710205078,0.9848346710205078,-1.0213555097579956

You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good <PER>’ library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading.

I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to <LOC>; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during <DATE> and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage.

552,"I was thus prepared to view the manoeuvering of “Old Charley” in a very different light from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of <ORG>. I saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr. <PER> in the carcass of the horse. I had not forgotten, although the <ORG> had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and another where it went out. If it were found in the animal then, after having made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by the person who found it. The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be capital claret, and no more. When I came to think of these things, and also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr. <PER>, I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong because I kept it altogether to myself. In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of Mr. <PER>, and, for good reasons, searched in <NUM> as divergent as possible from those to which Mr. <PER> conducted his party.

I procured a stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and deposited the latter in an old wine box—taking care so to double the body up as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had to press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top would fly off and the body up. Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it as already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants with whom Mr. <PER> dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to wheel the box to Mr. <PER>’s door, in a barrow, at a given signal from myself.",EdgarAllanPoe,HermanMelville,0.9068728089332581,0.9068728089332581,-1.6855181455612183

558,"And that is why this question of the state, dark as it is, portentous, hopeless as its aspects are, if we limit the survey to our present aids and instrumentalities, is already, to the eye of science, kindling with the aurora of unimagined change, advancements to the heights of man's felicity, that shall dim the airy portraiture of poets' visions, that shall outgo here, too, the world's young dreams with its scientific reality. There has been no help from science in this field hitherto. The proceeding of the world has been instinctive and empirical thus far, in the attainment of the ends which the complex nature of man requires him to seek. Men have been driven, and swayed hither and thither, by these different and apparently contradictory aims, without any _science_ of the forces that actuated them. Those ends these forces will <ORG> is their nature to,'--whether in man, or in any other form in which they are incorporated. There's no amount of declamation that is ever going to stop them.

It is the original constitution of things, as it was settled in that <ORG>, to whose acts the memory of Man runneth not, that is concerned in these demonstrations; and philosophy requires that whatever else we do, we should avoid, by all means, coming into any collision with those statutes. 'We must so order it,' says <PER> of the Mountain, quoting in this case from antiquity--'we must so order it, as by no means to contend with universal nature.'

We must begin by distinguishing 'what is in our power, and what not,' says the author of <ORG>, applying that universal rule of practice to our present subject. Here, then, carefully reduced to their most comprehensive form, traced to the height of universal nature, and brought down to the specific nature in man--here, as they lie on the ground of the common nature in man, for the <NUM> time scientifically abstracted--are the powers which science has to begin with in this field.

572,"I shall be here <TIME> or so.” When the doctor had moved off toward the house Mrs. <PER> nodded at her son knowingly. “Might's well walk <PER> into the barn and uncheck him, <PER>,” she said. “They'll keep him more'n <TIME>. That young man, '<PER> Forbes,--that young man's my _hope_.” Mrs. <PER> spoke impressively and shook her forefinger to emphasize her words. “What you hoping about him?” asked '<PER>, laying down the harness and proceeding to lead the gray horse up the incline into the barn. “Shouldn't wonder a mite if he was our deliverer,” went on Mrs. <PER>. “I saw it in Mrs. <PER>'s eye that he suited her, <TIME> that she met him here at dinner. I like him <NUM>-rate, and I don't mean him any harm; but he's one of these young doctors with plenty of money at his back, bound to have a fashionable practice and succeed. His face is in his favor, and I guess he knows as much as any of 'em, and he can afford the luxury of a wife brought up the way <PER> has been. That's right, <PER>. Unfasten the check-rein, though the doctor don't use a mean one, I must say. I only hope there's a purgatory for the folks that use too short check-reins on their horses.

That's what I hope!” '<PER> grinned. “You want 'em to try the cold place and the hot one too, do you?” “Yes I do, and to stay in the one that hurts the most. The man that uses a decent check-rein on his horse,” continued Mrs. <PER>, dropping into a philosophizing tone, “is apt to be as decent to his wife. The doctor would be a great catch for that girl, and I _think_,” dropping her voice, “her mother'd be liable to live with 'em.” “You're keeping that dark from the doctor, I s'pose?” remarked '<PER>. “H'm. You needn't think I go chattering around that house the way I do out here.

573,"“Fellows who have read medical books or fellows whose fathers and uncles had something hereditary in their heads--the whole air they breathe is mad.” “All the same,” said <PER>, shrewdly, “I bet you haven't found a madman of that sort.” “I bet I have!” cried <PER>, with unusual animation. “I've been walking about the garden talking to a poor chap all the morning. He's simply been broken down and driven raving by your damned science. Talk about believing one is God--why, it's quite an old, comfortable, fireside fancy compared with the sort of things this fellow believes. He believes that there is a God, but that he is better than God. He says God will be afraid to face him. He says <NUM> is always progressing beyond the best. He put his arm in mine and whispered in my ear, as if it were the apocalypse: 'Never trust a God that you can't improve on. '” “What can he have meant?” said the atheist, with all his logic awake. “Obviously one should not trust any God that one can improve on.” “It is the way he talks,” said <ORG>, almost indifferently; “but he says rummier things than that. He says that a man's doctor ought to decide what woman he marries; and he says that children ought not to be brought up by their parents, because a physical partiality will then distort the judgement of the educator.” “Oh, dear!” said <PER>, laughing, “you have certainly come across a pretty bad case, and incidentally proved your own. I suppose some men do lose their wits through science as through love and other good things.” “And he says,” went on <ORG>, monotonously, “that he cannot see why anyone should suppose that a triangle is a <NUM>-sided figure. He says that on some higher plane----” <PER> leapt to his feet as by an electric shock. “I never could have believed,” he cried, “that you had humour enough to tell a lie.

576,"He is going to collect, by his inductive method, from all nature, from all species, the principles that are in _all things_; and he is going to build, on the basis of those _inducted_ principles,--on the sure basis of that which is constant, and eternal, and universal in nature, the sure foundations of his universal practice; for, like common logic, the inductive method comprehends '_all_.' That same simplicity, which the abstract speculations of men aspire to, and create, _it_ aspires to and _attains_, by the rough roads, by the laboured stages of observation and experiment. He is, indeed, compelled to involve his phraseology here in a most studious haze of scholasticism. Perspicuity is by no means the quality of style most in request, when we come to these higher stages of sciences. Impenetrable mists, clouds, and darkness, impenetrable to any but the eye that seeks also the whole, involve the heaven-piercing peak of this new height of learning, this new summit of a scientific divinity, frowning off--warding off, as with the sword of the cherubim, the unbidden invaders of this new <ORG>, where sit the gods, restored again,--the simple powers of nature, recovered from the Greek abstractions,--not 'the idols'--not the impersonated abstractions, the false images of the mind of man--not the logical forms of those spontaneous abstractions, emptied of their poetic content--but the strong gods that make our history, that compose our epics, that conspire for our tragedies, whether we own them and build altars to them or not. This is that summit of the _prima philosophia_ where the axioms that command all are found--where the observations that are common to the sciences, and the precepts that are based on these, grow. This is that height where the _same_ footsteps of nature, treading in different substances or matters, lost in the difference below, are all cleared and identified.

Letting her hair fall about her like a veil, she caught up the doll and pressed it to her heart impulsively. “You are going to stay with her, <PER>! I envy you, I envy you!” she whispered. An irrepressible tear fell on the sumptuous trimming of the little hat. “Be good to her; comfort her, comfort her, little dolly.” Hastily wiping her eyes, she turned to her husband, still holding the doll. “We shall have to be very careful, <PER>, in the morning.

CHAPTER V BON VOYAGE At the dock <TIME> the scene was one of the usual confusion. The sailing time was drawing near and Mr. <PER> had not appeared. <PER>, with his little girl's hand in his, stood at the foot of the gang plank, peering at every newcomer and growing more anxious every moment. Jewel occupied herself in throwing kisses to her mother, who stood at the rail far above, never taking her eyes from the little figure in the blue sailor suit. The child noted her father's set lips and the concentrated expression of his eyes. “If grandpa doesn't come what shall I do?” she asked without anxiety. “You'll go to <LOC>,” was the prompt response. “Without my trunk!” returned the child in protest. Her father looked again at the watch he held in his hand. The order to go ashore was sending all visitors down the gang plank. “By <PER>, I guess you're going, too,” he muttered between his teeth, when suddenly his father's tall form came striding through the crowd. Mr. <PER> was carrying a long pasteboard box, and seemed breathless. “Horse fell down. Devil of a time! Roses for your wife.” <PER> grasped the box, touched his father's hand, kissed the child, and strode up the plank amid the frowns of officials. <ORG>'s eager eyes followed him, then, as he disappeared, lifted again to her mother, who smiled and waved her hand to Mr. <PER>. The latter raised his hat and took the occasion to wipe his heated brow. He was irritated through and through. <TIME> had been a chapter of accidents. Even the roses, which he had ordered the night before, had proved to be the wrong sort.",unknown,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9845490455627441,0.9845490455627441,-1.9917689561843872
579,"These difficulties could scarcely have been surmounted by the utmost caution; and as <PER>'s thoughts were too deeply fixed upon the end to pay a due regard to the means, he soon became desperately bewildered both as to the locality of the river and of the cottage. Had he known, however, in which direction to seek the latter, he would not, probably, have turned back; not that he was infected by any chivalrous desire to finish the adventure alone, but because he would expect little assistance from those he had left there. Yet he could not but wonder--though he had not in his <NUM> eagerness taken notice of it--at the anxiety of the old woman that he should proceed singly, and without the knowledge of her guests, on the search. He nevertheless continued to wander on,--pausing often to listen for the rush of the river, and then starting forward with fresh rapidity, to rid himself of the sting of his own thoughts, which became painfully intense when undisturbed by bodily motion. His way was now frequently interrupted by rocks, that thrust their huge gray heads from the ground, compelling him to turn aside, and thus depriving him, fortunately, perhaps, of all remaining idea of the direction he had intended to pursue. Thus he went on, his head turned back, and taking little heed to his footsteps, when, perceiving that he trod upon a smooth, level rock, he looked forward, and found himself almost on the utmost verge of a precipice. After the throbbing of the heart that followed this narrow escape had subsided, he stood gazing down where the sunbeams slept so pleasantly at the roots of the tall old trees, with whose highest tops he was upon a level. Suddenly he seemed to hear voices--one well-remembered voice--ascending from beneath; and, approaching to the edge of the cliff, he saw at its base the <NUM> whom he sought. He saw and interpreted <PER>'s look and attitude of entreaty, though the words with which she sought to soften the ruthless heart of her guide became inaudible ere they reached the height where <PER> stood. He felt that Heaven had sent him thither, at the moment of her utmost need, to be the preserver of all that was dear to him; and he paused only to consider the mode in which her deliverance was to be effected. Life he would have laid down willingly, exultingly: his only care was, that the sacrifice should not be in vain. At length, when <PER> fell upon her knees, he lifted a small fragment of rock, and threw it down the cliff.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9848671555519104,0.9848671555519104,-0.35373005270957947
580,"And if after having duly weighed the hints we have already received of the importance of the subject, we do not any longer suffer ourselves to be put off the track, or bewildered by the <NUM> rhetorical effect of the sentence in which these agencies are introduced to our attention,--if we look at that rapid series of words, as something else than the points of a period, if we stop long enough to recover from the confusion which a mere string of names, a catalogue or table of contents, crowded into single sentence, will, of necessity, create,--if we stop long enough to see that each one of these words is a point in the table of a new science, we shall perceive at once, that after having made all this large allowance, this _new_ allowance for that which is _without_ our power, there is still a very, very large margin of operation, and discovery, and experiment left; that there is still a large scope of _alteration_ left--alteration in man as he is.

584,"But the legend, though my version of it may be forgotten, will long be traditionary in that lonely spot, and give to the rock and the precipice and the fountain an interest thrilling to the bosom of the romantic wanderer.

THE WOODMAN'S BEAR. During <DATE> succeeding her danger and deliverance, <PER> was confined to her chamber by illness, resulting from the agitation she had endured. Her father embraced the earliest opportunity to express his deep gratitude to <PER> for the inestimable service he had rendered, and to intimate a desire to requite it to the utmost of his power.

If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.” “Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being. “Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I <NUM> sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.

591,"Other professions, involving a knowledge of technicalities and things restricted to <NUM> particular field of action, are frequently mastered by men who begin after <DATE>, or even at a later period of life. It was only about the middle of the seventeenth century that the British military and naval services were kept distinct.

The lowness of matter, all the capabilities and actualities of speech and action, not of the refined only, but of the vulgar and profane, are included in the science which contemplates an historical result, and which proposes the _reform_ of these actualities, the cure of these maladies,--which comprehends man as man in its intention,--which makes the _Common Weal_ its end. Science is the word that unlocks the books of this <ORG>, its gravest and its lightest, its books of loquacious prose and stately allegory, and its Book of Sports and Riddles. Science is the clue that still threads them, that never breaks, in all their departures from the decorums of literature, in their lowest descents from the refinements of society. The vulgarity is not _the_ vulgarity of the vulgar--the inelegancy is not the spontaneous rudeness of the ill-bred--any more than its doctrine of nature is the doctrine of the unlearned.

605,"It is the representative of an heroic aristocracy, not <NUM> of ancient privilege merely, not <NUM> armed with parchments only, claiming descent from heroes; but the yet living leaders of the rabble people to military conquest, and the only leaders who are understood to be able to marshal from their ranks an effective force for military defence. But this is not all. The scope of the poetic design requires here, under the sheath which this dramatic exhibition of an ancient aristocracy offers it, the impersonation of another and more sovereign difference in men; and this poet has ends to serve, to which a mere historical accuracy in the reproduction of this ancient struggle of state-factions, in an extinct European common-wealth, is of little consequence; though he is not wanting in that either, or indifferent to it, when occasion serves. From the _speeches_ inserted here and there, we find that this is at the same time an aristocracy of learning which is put upon the stage here, that it is an aristocracy of statesmanship and civil ability, that it is composed of the select men of the state, and not its elect only; that it is the true and natural head of the healthful body politic, and not 'the horn of the monster' only. This is the aristocracy which appears to be in session in the background of this piece at least, and we are not without some occasional glimpses of their proceedings, and this is the element of the poetic combination which comes out in the _dialogue_, whenever the necessary question of the play requires it. For it is the collision between the civil interests and the interests which the unlearned heroic ages enthrone, that is coming off here. It is the collision between the government which uneducated masses of men create and confirm, and recreate in any age, and the government which the enlightened man 'in a better hour' demands, which the common sense and sentiment of man, as distinguished from the brute, demands, whether in the one, or the few, or the many.--This is the struggle which is getting into form and order here,--here _<NUM>_.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9563815593719482,0.9563815593719482,-3.185094118118286

This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of <PER>, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when <PER> was <DATE>, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in <LOC> does not mean the same thing as a servant in <LOC> and <LOC>. <PER>, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being. “<PER>, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, <NUM> glance from <PER> could dissipate it, for the same reason that <ORG> gives concerning the beauty of <PER>—she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at <NUM> intended. This benefit was fully repaid; <PER> was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.",unknown,JaneAusten,0.9990623593330383,0.9990623593330383,-0.7037159204483032
623,"He knows how weak I am, and that I might forget the peril of the faith, forget the face of Our Lady--yes, even with your blow upon her cheek. But the honour of this earth has just this about it, that it can make a man's heart like iron. I am from the Lords of the <LOC> and I dare not be a mere deserter. Therefore, God has tied me by the chain of my worldly place and word, and there is nothing but fighting now.” “I think I understand you,” said <PER>, “but you say everything tail foremost.” “She wants us to do it,” said <PER>, in a voice crushed with passion. “She has hurt herself so that we might do it. She has left her good name and her good sleep and all her habits and dignity flung away on the other side of <LOC> in the hope that she may hear of us and that we have broken some hole into heaven.” “I thought I knew what you mean,” said <PER>, biting his beard; “it does seem as if we ought to do something after all she has done <TIME>.” “I never liked you so much before,” said <ORG>, in bitter sorrow. As he spoke, <NUM> solemn footmen came out of the lodge gate and assembled to assist the chauffeur to his room. The mere sight of them made the <NUM> wanderers flee as from a too frightful incongruity, and before they knew where they were, they were well upon the grassy ledge of <LOC> that overlooks the <ORG>. <PER> said suddenly: “Will they let me see her in heaven once in <DATE>?” and addressed the remark to the editor of _The <ORG>_, as on which he would be likely or qualified to answer. But no answer came; a silence sank between the <NUM>. <PER> strode sturdily to the edge of the cliff and looked out, his companion following, somewhat more shaken by his recent agitation. “If that's the view you take,” said <PER>, “and I don't say you are wrong, I think I know where we shall be best off for the business. As it happens, I know this part of the south coast pretty well. And unless I am mistaken there's a way down the cliff just here which will land us on a stretch of firm sand where no one is likely to follow us.” The <ORG> made a gesture of assent and came also almost to the edge of the precipice.",Chesterton,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9943247437477112,0.9943247437477112,-0.39522784948349
624,"You answer the questions and do nothing else.” “I did nothing else,” said <PER>, with a slight smile. “Eh,” cried <PER>, glaring through his eye-glass. “You asked me why I broke his window,” said <ORG>, with a face of wood. “I answered, 'Because he blasphemed Our Lady.' I had no other reason. So I have no other answer.” Vane continued to gaze at him with a sternness not habitual to him. “You are not going the right way to work, Sir,” he said, with severity. “You are not going the right way to work to--a--have your case treated with special consideration. If you had simply expressed regret for what you had done, I should have been strongly inclined to dismiss the matter as an outbreak of temper. Even now, if you say that you are sorry I shall only----” “But I am not in the least sorry,” said <PER>, “I am very pleased.” “I really believe you are insane,” said the stipendiary, indignantly, for he had really been doing his best as a good-natured man, to compose the dispute. “What conceivable right have you to break other people's windows because their opinions do not agree with yours? This man only gave expression to his sincere belief.” “So did I,” said the <ORG>. “And who are you?” exploded <LOC>. “Are your views necessarily the right ones? Are you necessarily in possession of the truth?” “Yes,” said <ORG>. The magistrate broke into a contemptuous laugh. “Oh, you want a nurse to look after you,” he said. “You must pay <ORG>.” <PER> plunged his hands into his loose grey garment and drew out a queer looking leather purse. It contained exactly <NUM> sovereigns. He paid down the <NUM>, coin by coin, in silence, and equally silently returned the remaining <NUM> to the receptacle. Then he said, “May I say a word, your worship?” <ORG> seemed <NUM> hypnotized with the silence and automatic movements of the stranger; he made a movement with his head which might have been either “yes” or “no”. “I only wished to say, your worship,” said <ORG>, putting back the purse in his trouser pocket, “that smashing that shop window was, I confess, a useless and rather irregular business.

625,"He became at once the centre of that little circle of highborn wits and poets, the elder wits and poets of the <LOC> age, that were then in their meridian there. Sir <PER>, <PER>, <PER>, <PER> of Oxford, and some others, are included in the contemporary list of this courtly company, whose doings are somewhat mysteriously adverted to by a critic, who refers to the condition of 'the Art of Poesy' at that time. '_The gentleman who wrote the late Shepherds' Calendar_' was beginning then to attract considerable attention in this literary aristocracy. The brave, bold genius of <ORG> flashed new life into that little nucleus of the <LOC> development. The new '_Round Table_,' which that newly-beginning age of chivalry, with its new weapons and devices, and its new and more heroic adventure had created, was not yet 'full' till he came in. The Round Table grew rounder with this knight's presence. Over those dainty stores of <DATE>, over those quaint memorials of the elder chivalry, that were spread out on it, over the dead letter of the past, the brave <LOC> breeze came in, the breath of the great future blew, when the turn came for this knight's adventure; whether opened in the prose of its statistics, or set to its native music in the mystic melodies of the bard who was there to sing it. The Round Table grew spheral, as he sat talking by it; the Round Table dissolved, as he brought forth his lore, and unrolled his maps upon it; and instead of it,--with all its fresh yet living interests, tracked out by land and sea, with the great battle-ground of the future outlined on it,--revolved the round world. '_Universality_' was still the motto of these <ORG>; but 'THE GLOBE'--the Globe, with its <NUM> hemispheres, became henceforth their device. The promotion of <ORG> was all that was needed to make him the centre and organiser of that new intellectual movement which was then just beginning there.

626,"I was out of the river, and dressing instantly. In the shock I had taken some water into my mouth, and it turned me sick, for I fancied that the contamination of the creature was in it. I had got back to my cool darkened room in the hotel, and was lying on a sofa there, before I began to reason with myself. Of course, I knew perfectly well that the large dark creature was stone dead, and that I should no more come upon him out of the place where I had seen him dead, than I should come upon the cathedral of Notre-Dame in an entirely new situation. What troubled me was the picture of the creature; and that had so curiously and strongly painted itself upon my brain, that I could not get rid of it until it was worn out. I noticed the peculiarities of this possession, while it was a real discomfort to me. That very day, at dinner, some morsel on my plate looked like a piece of him, and I was glad to get up and go out. <TIME>, I was walking along the Rue St. Honoré, when I saw a bill at a public room there, announcing small-sword exercise, broad-sword exercise, wrestling, and other such feats. I went in, and some of the sword-play being very skilful, remained. A specimen of our own national sport, The British Boaxe, was announced to be given at the close of the evening. In <TIME>, I determined to wait for this <PER>, as became a <PER>. It was a clumsy specimen (executed by <NUM> English grooms out of place), but <NUM> of the combatants, receiving a straight right-hander with the glove between his eyes, did exactly what the large dark creature in the Morgue had seemed going to do—and finished me for <TIME>. There was rather a sickly smell (not at all an unusual fragrance in <LOC>) in the little ante-room of my apartment at the hotel. The large dark creature in the Morgue was by no direct experience associated with my sense of smell, because, when I came to the knowledge of him, he lay behind a wall of thick plate-glass as good as a wall of steel or marble for that matter. Yet the whiff of the room never failed to reproduce him. What was more curious, was the capriciousness with which his portrait seemed to light itself up in my mind, elsewhere. I might be walking in the Palais Royal, lazily enjoying the shop windows, and might be regaling myself with one of the ready-made clothes shops that are set out there.",CharlesDickens,unknown,0.5410639643669128,,-5.572752952575684
627,"'Men have proposed to answer <NUM> different and contrary ends by the use of parables, for they serve as well to _instruct_ and _illustrate_ as to _wrap up and envelope_, so that, though for the present, we drop the concealed use, and suppose them to be _vague undeterminate things_, formed for AMUSEMENT merely, still the other _use_ remains. 'And every man of _any_ learning must readily concede,' he says, 'the value of that use of them as a method of popular instruction, grave, sober, exceedingly useful, and sometimes necessary in the _sciences_, as it opens an easy and _familiar_ passage to the human understandings in _all new_ discoveries, that are abstruse and out of the road of vulgar opinion. They were used of old by _philosophers_ to express any point of reason more sharp and subtle than the vulgar, and nevertheless _now_, and _at all times_, these allusive parabolical forms retain much life and vigor, because _reason_ cannot be _so sensible_ nor _examples so fit_.' That philosophic use of them was to inform and teach, whilst the minds of men continued rude and unpractised in matters of subtilty and speculation, and even impatient and in a manner incapable of receiving anything that did not directly fall under and strike the senses. 'And, even to <DATE>, if any man would let new light in upon the human understanding, and conquer prejudices without raising animosities, opposition, or _disturbance_, he must still go in _the same path_ and have recourse to the like method.'

But when he comes to speak specifically of _writing_ as a means of tradition, he confines his remarks to that particular kind of writing, which is agreed on betwixt particular persons, and called by the name of _cipher_, giving excellent reasons for this proceeding, impertinent as it may seem, to those who think that his only object is to make out a list and 'muster-roll of the arts and sciences';--stopping to tell us plainly that he knows what he is about, and that he has not brought in '_these private and retired arts_,' with so much stress, and under so many heads, in connection with 'the principal and <ORG>,' and _the mode of their tradition_, without having some occasion for it. 'Ciphers are commonly in letters, or alphabets, but _may be_ in words,' he says, proceeding to enumerate the different kinds, and furnishing on the spot, some pretty specimens of what may be done in the way of that kind which he calls 'doubles,' a kind which he is particularly fond of; one hears again the echo of those delicate, collateral sounds, which our friend, over the mountains, warned us of, declining to say any more about them in that place. In the later edition, he takes occasion to say, in this connection, 'that as writing in the received manner no way obstructs the _manner of pronunciation_, but leaves that _free_, an innovation in it is of no purpose.' And if a cipher be the proper name for a private method of writing, agreed on betwixt particular persons, it is certainly the name for the method which he proposes to adopt in _his_ tradition of the principal sciences; as he takes occasion to inform those whom it may concern, in an early portion of the work, and when he is occupied in the critical task of putting down some of the primary terms.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9624950289726257,0.9624950289726257,-1.3434114456176758

The landlord cast his eye, ever and anon, along the road that led down the valley in the direction of the village: and at last, when the sun was wearing west-ward, he discovered the approach of a horseman.

Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of <NUM> beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind.

650,"And this, also, is an _actual_ force in man, proceeding from the universal nature of things and original in that, not in him. This, also, is in the primeval creative stamp of things; and here, also, the science of the interpretation of nature finds in the constitution of man, and in the nature of things, the foundations of the true state ready to its hand; and hewn, all hewn and cut, and joined with nature's own true and cunning hand ere man was, the everlasting pillars of the common-weal. But in man _this_ law, also,--this law chiefly,--has its _special_, essentially special, development. 'It is much _more_ impressed on man, if he de-_generate_ not.' Great buildings have been reared on this foundation already; great buildings, old and time-honoured, stand on it. The history of human nature is glorious, even in its degeneracy, with the exhibition of this larger, nobler form of humanity asserting itself, triumphing over the intensities of the narrower motivity. It is a species in which the organic law transcends the individual, and embraces the kind; it is a constitution of nature, in which those who seek the good of the kind, and subordinate the private nature to that, are noble, and chief. It is a species in which the law of the common-weal is for ever present to the private nature, as the law of its own being, requiring, under the pains and penalties of the universal laws of being, subjection. Science cannot originate new forces in nature. 'Man, while operating, can only apply or withdraw natural forces. Nature, internally, performs the rest.' But here are the very forces that we want. If man were, indeed, naturally and constitutionally, that mere species of 'vermin' which, under certain modes of culture, with great facility he becomes, there would be no use in spending words upon this subject. Science could not undertake the common-weal in that case. If nature's word had been here dissolution, isolation, single intention in the parts and members of that body that science sought to frame, what word of creative art could she pronounce, what bonds of life could she find, what breath of God could she boast, that she should think to frame of such material the body politic, the organic whole, the living, free, harmonious, triumphant common-weal. But here are the very forces that we want, blindly moving, moving in the dark, left to intuition and instinct, where nature had provided reason, and required science and scientific art.

652,"It is 'metaphysical aid' that he offers us; it is magic, but, 'magic lawful as eating'; it is a priestly aid that he offers us, the aid of one who has penetrated to the inner sanctuary of the law,--the priest of nature, newly instructed in her mind and will, who comes forth from his long communing with her, with her own 'great seal' in his hands--with the rod of her enchantments, that old magicians desired to pluck from her, and did not--with the gift of the new and nobler miracles of science as the witness of his anointing--with the reading of 'God's book of power'--with the alphabet of its mystery, as the proof of his ordaining--with the key of it, hid from the foundation of the world until now.

Think of the condition of <LOC> during that time, with her brutal aristocracy and her drunken democracy, her murders on either side, her Siberian horrors, her Jew baitings and her corruption. Think of the figure of <ORG>, an incarnate devil who from motives of greed carried murder and torture through a large section of <LOC>, and yet was received in every court, and was eventually buried after a panegyric from a Cardinal of <ORG>--a church which had never once raised her voice against his diabolical career.

Nevertheless, it is hard to bring the men of my time to it.

One must try it on all points, to see _how it is lodged in the author_: _for_ one must not always _presently yield_ what truth or beauty soever seem to be in the argument.' A little delay, and opposition, the necessity of hunting, or fighting, for it, will only make it the more esteemed in the end. In such a style, 'either the author must stoutly oppose it [that is, whatsoever beauty or truth is to be the end of the argument in order to challenge the reader] or draw back, under colour of not understanding it, or, sometimes, perhaps, he may aid the point, and carry it _beyond_ its proper reach [and so forcing the reader to correct him.

For the perpetual, the universal interest of this experiment arises from the fact, that it is not as _the king_ merely, dissolving like 'a mockery king of snow' that this illustrious form stands here, to undergo this fierce analysis, but as the representative, 'the conspicuous instance,' of that social name and figure, which all men carry about with them, and take to be a part of themselves, that outward life, in which men go beyond themselves, by means of their affections, and extend their identity, incorporating into their very personality, that floating, contingent material which the wills and humours and opinions, the prejudices and passions of others, and the variable tide of this world's fortunes make--that social <PER> and Figure in which men may die many times, ere the physical life is required of them, in which all men must needs live if they will live in it at all, at the mercy of these uncontrolled social eventualities. The tragedy is complicated, but it is only that same complication which the tragedy it stands for, is always exhibiting. The fact that this blow to his state is dealt to him by those to whom nature herself had so dearly and tenderly bound him, nay, with whom she had so hopelessly identified him, is that which overwhelms the sufferer. It is that which he seeks to understand in vain.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9694401025772095,0.9694401025772095,-1.2096986770629883

They appear to involve the intimation that many of our books on moral philosophy, come to us from the youthful and poetic ages of the world, ages in which sentiment and spontaneous conviction supplied the place of learning; for the accumulations of ages of experiment and conclusion, tend to maturity and sobriety of judgment in the race, as do the corresponding accumulations in the individual experience and memory.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9705214500427246,0.9705214500427246,-1.8597887754440308

Nothing which could be said was able entirely to quiet the apprehension that his uncle would walk in upon him, surrounded as he was by forbidden companions, and a luxury which his tyrant had not been invited to share.

731,"As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of <ORG> in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased. I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased <TIME>, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from <PER>, the <PER>, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in <LOC>, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of <ORG>. Another storm enlightened <ORG> with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the <ORG>, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake. While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, “<PER>, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not doubt it.

742,"The whole story of the _base_ and base-born one, who makes what he calls _nature_--the rude, brutal, spontaneous nature--his goddess and his law, and ignores the human distinction; this part was needed in order to supply the deficiences in the social diagrams which the original plot presented; and, indeed, the whole story of <ORG>, which is from <NUM> to last a clear <LOC> invention, and of which this of <PER> is but a part, was not less essential for the same purpose. Neither does one need to go very far beneath the surface, to perceive a new and extraordinary treatment of the ethical principle in this play throughout; one which the new, artistic, practical 'stand-point' here taken naturally suggested, but one which could have proceeded only from the inmost heart of the new philosophy. It is just the kind of treatment which the proposal to introduce the Inductive method of inquiry into this department of the human practice inevitably involved. A disposition to go behind the ethical phenomena, to pursue the investigation to its scientific conclusion, a refusal to accept the facts which, to the unscientific observation, appear to be the ultimate ones--a refusal to accept the coarse, vague, spontaneous notions of <DATE>, as the solution of these so essential phenomena, is everywhere betraying and declaring itself. <PER>'s agonised invocation and summons to the unpublished forces of nature, to be aidant and remediate to the good man's distress, is continually echoed by the poet, but with a broader application. It is not the bodily malady and infirmity only--it is not that kind of madness, only with which the poor king is afflicted in the later stages of the play, which appears to him to need scientific treatment--it is not for the cure of these alone that he would open his <PER> book, 'nature's infinite book of secresy,' as he calls it in <PER> Antony--'the true magic,' as he calls it _elsewhere_--the book of the unpublished laws--the scientific book of 'KINDS'--the book of 'the historic laws'--'the book of God's power.' All the _interior_ phenomena which attend the violation of duty are strictly omitted here. That psychological exhibition of it belongs to other plays; and the Poet has left us, as we all know, no room to suspect the tenderness of his moral sensibility, or the depth of his acquaintance with these subjective phenomena. The _social_ consequences of the violation of duty in all the human relationships, the consequence to _others_, and the _social reaction_, limits the exhibition here.",unknown,OscarWilde,0.9020851254463196,0.9020851254463196,-4.388050556182861

748,"I <NUM> became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise. The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best <DATE> spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him <NUM> in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. <DATE> he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a <LOC>, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9775081276893616,0.9775081276893616,-0.8223176598548889

And by way of emphasizing this particular still further, he mentions, that on the occasion when <PER>, the Duke of Normandy, the son of <LOC> the <NUM>, of <LOC>, made a feast in <LOC>, the concourse of nobility and gentry was so great, that for _sport's sake_ he divided them into _troops, according to their names_, and in the _<NUM> troop, which consisted of <PER>_, there were found <NUM> knights sitting at the table of that name, without reckoning the simple gentlemen and servants. And here he apparently digresses from his subject for the sake of mentioning the Emperor _Geta_, 'who distributed the several courses of his meats by the _<NUM> letters of the meats_ themselves, where those that began with _B_ were served up together; _as_ brawn, beef, <LOC>, and so of the others.'",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9721678495407104,0.9721678495407104,-0.994708240032196
773,"The effect of 'poisoned flattery,' and 'titles blown from adulation' on the minds, of those to whose single will and caprice the whole welfare of the state, and all the gravest questions for this life and the next, were then entrusted, naturally appeared to the philosophical mind, perseveringly addicted to inquiries, in which the practical interests of men were involved, a question of gravest moment. But here it is the physical difference which accompanies this so immense human distinction, which he appears to be in quest of; it is the control over nature with which these '_farcical titles_' invest their possessor, that he appears to be now pertinaciously bent upon ascertaining. For we shall find, as we pursue the subject, that this is not an accidental point here, a casual incident of the character, or of the plot, a thing which belongs to the play, and not to the author; but that this is a poet who is somehow perpetually haunted with the impression that those who assume a divine right to control, and dispose of their fellow-men, ought to exhibit some sign of their authority; some superior abilities; some magical control; some light and power that other men have not. How he came by any such notions, the critic of his works is, of course, not bound to show; but that which meets him at the <NUM> reading is the fact, the incontestable fact, that the Poet of Shakspere's stage, be he who he may, is a poet whose mind is in some way deeply occupied with this question; that it is a poet who is infected, and, indeed, perfectly possessed, with the idea, that the true human leadership ought to consist in the ability to extend the empire of man over nature,--in the ability to unite and control men, and lead them in battalions against those common evils which infest the human conditions,--not fevers only but 'worser' evils, and harder to be cured, and to the conquest of those supernal blessings which the human race have always been vainly crying for. 'I am a king that find thee,' he says. And having this inveterate notion of a true human regality to begin with, he is naturally the more curious and prying in regard to the claims of the one which he finds in possession; and when by the mystery of his profession and art, he contrives to get the cloak of that factitious royalty about him, he asks questions under its cover which another man would not think of putting.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9156447649002075,0.9156447649002075,-2.2253243923187256

780,"As to that spontaneity, that seizure, that Platonic divination, that poetic 'fury,' which our prose philosopher scans in so many places so curiously, which he defines so carefully and strictly, so broadly too, as the _poetic_ condition that thing which he appears to admire so much, as having something a little demoniacal in it withal, that same 'fine' thing which the Poet himself speaks of by a term not any less questionable,--as to this poetic inspiration, it is not necessary to claim that it is a thing with which this Poet, the Poet of a new era, the Poet, the deliverer of <ORG>, has had himself, personally, no acquaintance. He knows what it is. But it is a Poet who is, <NUM> of all, a man, and he takes his humanity with him into all things.

Neither of them had the smallest qualification for managing such a vessel; but <ORG> had a practical knowledge of the sea in much smaller and quite different boats, while <PER> had an abstract knowledge of science and some of its applications to navigation, which was worse.

804,"<PER> in plenty,--gods, and demi-gods, and heroes, _not_ wanting; the purest abstract notions of virtue and felicity, the most poetic embodiments of them, are put down among the goods which the human estate, as it is, comprehends. This part of the subject appears, to the critical reviewer, to have been exhausted by the poets and artists that mankind has always employed to supply its wants in this field. No room for a poet here! The draught of the ideal <LOC> is finished;--the divine exemplar is finished; that which is wanting is,--_the husbandry <ORG>_. Till now, the philosophers and poetic teachers had always taken their stand at once, on the topmost peak of <ORG>, pouring down volleys of scorn, and amazement, and reprehension, upon the vulgar nature they saw beneath, made out of the dust of the ground, and qualified with the essential attributes of that material,--kindled, indeed, with a breath of heaven, but made out of clay,--different kinds of clay,--with more or less of the <ORG> spark in it; but always clay, of <NUM> kind or another, and always compelled to listen to the laws that are common to the kinds of that substance. And it was to this creature, thus bound by nature, thus _doubly_ bound,--'crawling between earth and heaven,' as the poet has it,--that these winged philosophers on the ideal cliffs, thought it enough to issue their mandates, commanding it to renounce its conditions, to ignore its laws, and come up thither at a word,--at a leap,--making no ado about it. 'I can call spirits from the <ORG> deep.' 'And so can I, and so can any man;' Says the new philosopher-- 'But will they _come?_ _Will they come_--when you do call for them?' It was simply a command, that this dirty earth should convert itself straight into Elysian lilies, and bloom out, at a word, with roses of <ORG>. Excellent patterns, celestial exemplars, of the things required were held up to it; and endless declamation and argument why it should be that, and not the other, were not wanting:--but as to any scientific inquiry into the nature of the thing on which this form was to be superinduced, as to any _scientific_ exhibition of the form itself which was to be superinduced, these so essential conditions of the proposed result, were in this case alike wanting.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9794880747795105,0.9794880747795105,-0.7376875877380371
805,"It was only within the walls of a school that the great principle of the new philosophy of fact and practice, which had to pretend to be profoundly absorbed in chemical experiments, or in physical observations, and inductions of some kind--though not without an occasional hint of a broader <PER> was only in _esoteric_ language that the great principles of this philosophy could begin to be set forth _in their true comprehension_. The very trunk of it, the primal science itself, must needs be mystified and hidden in a shower of metaphysical dust, and piled and heaped about with the old dead branches of scholasticism, lest men should see for themselves _how_ broad and comprehensive _must_ be the ultimate sweep of its determinations; lest men should see for themselves, how a science which begins in fact, and returns to it again, which begins in observation and experiment, and returns in scientific practice, in scientific arts, in scientific re-formation, might have to do, ere all was done, with facts not then inviting scientific investigation--with arts not then inviting scientific reform. In consequence of a sudden and common advancement of intelligence among the leading men of that age, which left the standard of intelligence represented in <NUM> of its existing institutions, very considerably in the rear of its advancement, there followed, as the inevitable result, a tendency to the formation of some medium of expression,--whether that tendency was artistically developed or not, in which the new and nobler thoughts of men, in which their dearest beliefs, could find some vent and limited interchange and circulation, without startling the _ear_. Eventually there came to be a number of men in <LOC> at this time,--and who shall say that there were none on the continent of this school,--occupying prominent positions in the state, heading, it might be, or ranged in opposite factions at <ORG>, who could speak and write in such a manner, upon topics of common interest, as to make themselves entirely intelligible to each other, without exposing themselves to any of the risks, which confidential communications under such circumstances involved. For there existed a certain mode of expression, originating in some of its more special forms with this particular school, yet not altogether conventional, which enabled those who made use of it to steer clear of <ORG> and its sister institution; inasmuch as the terms employed in this mode of communication were not in the more obvious interpretation of them actionable, and to a vulgar, unlearned, or stupid conceit, could hardly be made to appear so.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9876640439033508,0.9876640439033508,-0.36586904525756836

809,"Let us all thank God, and take heart again, and try to revive those notions of human dignity and common human sense which this story sets at nought, and see if we cannot heal that great jar in our abused natures which this chimera of <DATE> makes in it--this night-mare of modern criticism which lies with its dead weight on all our higher art and learning--this creature that came in on us unawares, when the interpretation of the <ORG> had outgrown the Play-tradition, when '_the Play_' had outgrown '_the Player_.' It is a play in which the manliest of human voices is heard sounding throughout the order of it; it is a play stuffed to its fool's gibe, with the soberest, deepest, maturest human sense; and 'the tears of it,' as we who have tested it know, 'the tears of it are wet.' It is a play where the choicest seats, the seats in which those who see it _all_ must sit, are 'reserved;' and there is a price to be paid for these: 'children and fools' will continue to have theirs for nothing.

811,"'And the reason why books' (which are adapted to the popular belief in these early and unlearned ages) 'are of so little effect towards _honesty of life_, is that they are not read and _revolved_--revolved--as they should be, by _men in mature <DATE>_.' But unlearned people are always beginners. And it is dangerous to put them upon the task, or to leave them to the task of remodelling their beliefs and adapting them to the advancing stages of human development. He, too, thinks it is easier to overthrow the old opinions, than it is to discriminate that which is to be conserved in them. The hints here are of the most profoundly cautious kind--as they have need to be--but they point to the danger which attends the advancement of learning when rashly and unwisely conducted, and the danger of introducing opinions which are in advance of the popular culture; dangers of which the history of former times furnished eminent examples and warnings then; warnings which have since been repeated in modern instances. He proposes that books shall be tried by their effects on manners. If they fail to produce HONESTY OF LIFE, and if certain particular forms of truth which were once effective to that end, in the course of a popular advancement, or change of any kind, have lost that virtue, let them be examined; let the translation of them be scientifically accomplished, so that the main truth be not lost in the process, so that men be not compelled by fearful experience to retrace their steps in search of it, even, perhaps, to the resuming of the old, dead form again, with all its cumbrous inefficacies; for the lack of a leadership which should have been able to discriminate for them, and forestall this empirical procedure. Speaking of books of Moral science in general, and their adaptation to different ages, he says--'Did not one of the _fathers_, in great indignation, call POESY ""_<PER>_,"" because it <PER> _temptations_, _perturbations_, and _vain opinions_?

[And our Poet, we may remark in passing, seems to have been struck with that same observation; for by a happy coincidence, he appears to have it in his commonplace book too, and he has not only made a note of it, as this one has, but has taken the trouble to translate it into verse.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.5575952529907227,0.5575952529907227,-5.223593235015869

Her hopes were dashed, for just as they were rising from the table, a man was announced, with whom Mr. <PER> closeted himself in the library. In the drawing-room aunt <ORG> and cousin <PER> both set themselves at letter-writing, and entirely ignored <PER>. The child looked listlessly at a book with pictures, which she found on the table, until <DATE>, when Mrs. <PER> came to say it was time for her to go to bed. She rose and stood a moment, turning hesitatingly from her aunt to her cousin. “Oh, is it bedtime?” asked aunt <ORG>, looking up from her letter. “Good-night, <LOC>. I hope you'll sleep well.” Then she returned to her writing. <PER> bit her lip as she regarded the little girl with a moment's hesitation, but no, she had decided on her plan of action. Mrs. <PER> was observing her. <PER> knew the housekeeper's attitude toward them was defensive, if not offensive. “Good-night,” she said briefly, and looked down again. “Good-night,” returned <ORG> quietly, and went out. In the hall she hesitated. “I want to say good-night to grandpa,” she said. “Well, you can't,” returned Mrs. <PER> decidedly. “He is talking business and mustn't be disturbed.” She followed the child up the staircase. “I could go to bed alone, if I only knew where the matches are.” “You said you could dress alone, but you had to ask Mrs. <PER> to button your frock. Remember after this that I am the one to ask. She and Miss <PER> don't want to be bothered.” “Is it a bother to do a kindness?” asked <PER> in a subdued tone. “To some folks it is,” was the response. They had reached the door of the child's room; “but some folks can see their duty and do it,” she added virtuously. <PER> realized regretfully that her present companion belonged to the latter class. “Now here, right inside the door,” proceeded Mrs. <PER>, “is the switch. There's electricity all over this house, and you don't need any matches.

823,"The roses were red hot; the clematis was, so to speak, blue hot. And yet the mere whiteness of the <LOC> seemed the most violent colour of all. As the golden sunlight gradually conquered the mists, it had really something of the sensational sweetness of the slow opening of the gates of <LOC>. MacIan, whose mind was always haunted with such seraphic or titanic parallels, made some such remark to his companion. But <PER> only cursed and said that it was the back garden of some damnable rich man. When the last haze had faded from the ordered paths, the open lawns, and the flaming flower-beds, the <NUM> realized, not without an abrupt re-examination of their position, that they were not alone in the garden. Down the centre of the central garden path, preceded by a blue cloud from a cigarette, was walking a gentleman who evidently understood all the relish of a garden in the very <TIME>. He was a slim yet satisfied figure, clad in a suit of pale-grey tweed, so subdued that the pattern was imperceptible--a costume that was casual but not by any means careless. His face, which was reflective and somewhat over-refined, was the face of a quite elderly man, though his stringy hair and moustache were still quite yellow. A double eye-glass, with a broad, black ribbon, drooped from his aquiline nose, and he smiled, as he communed with himself, with a self-content which was rare and almost irritating.

It needed the full shock of the huge shadow of <ORG>, falling across his sunlit path, to rouse him from his smiling reverie.

He was a gentleman; that is, he had social presence of mind, whether for kindness or for insolence. “Can I do anything for you?” he said, at last. MacIan bowed. “You can extend to us your pardon,” he said, for he also came of a whole race of gentlemen--of gentlemen without shirts to their backs. “I am afraid we are trespassing. We have just come over the wall.” “Over the wall?” repeated the smiling old gentleman, still without letting his surprise come uppermost.",Chesterton,VirginiaWoolf,0.6183934807777405,0.6183934807777405,-6.302949905395508
824,"I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe. Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, “My dearest <PER>, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.” “I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.

825,"They were no longer there,--a circumstance easily accounted for by the haste with which the bridles had been thrown over the branch of the tree. Her companion, however, imputed it to another cause. ""The hag! She would sell her own flesh and blood by weight and measure,"" he muttered to himself. ""This is some plot of hers, I know well."" He put his hand to his forehead for a moment's space, seeming to reflect on the course most advisable to be pursued. <PER>, perhaps unwisely, interposed. ""Would it not be well to return?"" she asked, timidly. ""There is now no hope of escaping; but I might yet reach home undiscovered.""

They stood beneath a precipice, so high that the loftiest pine-tops (and many of them seemed to soar to heaven) scarcely surmounted it. This line of rock has a considerable extent, at unequal heights, and with many interruptions, along the course of the river; and it seems probable that, at some former period, it was the boundary of the waters, though they are now confined within far less ambitious limits.

He looked across at the child, who was situated as before at the table, her crossed feet, in their <DATE>-heeled shoes, dangling beneath. “May I smoke, <PER>?” he asked, as he took a cigar from the case. He asked the question humorously, but the reply was serious. “Oh yes, grandpa, of course; this is your room; but you know nobody likes tobacco naturally except a worm.” Mr. <PER>'s deep-set eyes widened. “Is it possible? Well, we're all worms.” <PER> smiled fondly at him, her head a little on one side, in its characteristic attitude. “You're such a joker,” she returned. “If you really dislike smoke,” said the broker after <TIME>, “perhaps you'd better take your letter up to your room.” “I don't mind it,” she returned. “Father used to smoke.

During the interval, the emigrants were obliged to remain below; but this was nothing strange to some of them; who, not recovering, while at sea, from their <NUM> attack of seasickness, seldom or never made their appearance on deck, during the entire passage. During <DATE>, now in question, fire was only once made in the public galley. This occasioned a good deal of domestic work to be done in the steerage, which otherwise would have been done in the open air. When the lulls of the rain-storms would intervene, some unusually cleanly emigrant would climb to the deck, with a bucket of slops, to toss into the sea.

Now, this captain of the bow-chaser was an upright old man, a sincere, humble believer, and he but earned his bread in being captain of that gun; but how, with those hands of his begrimed with powder, could he break that _other_ and most peaceful and penitent bread of the Supper? though in that hallowed sacrament, it seemed, he had often partaken ashore. The omission of this rite in a man-of-war—though there is a chaplain to preside over it, and at least a few communicants to partake—must be ascribed to a sense of religious propriety, in the last degree to be commended.

Here we have the mere phenomena of the human speciality put forward as science, without any attempt to find their genera,--to trace them to that which is more known to nature, so as to connect them practically with the diversity and opposition, which the actual conditions of practice present. We have not, in short, the scientific language here yet. The vices and the virtues do not understand the names by which we call them, and undertake to command them. Those are not the names in that 'infinite book of secrecy' which they were taught in. They find a more potent order there.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9783822298049927,0.9783822298049927,-0.735264003276825

The tall man sitting on the gravel bowed with urbanity, and said: “Quite at your service. Not to be confused with <ORG>; and as I say, old boy, what have you done with my yacht? You see, they've locked me up here--in this garden--and a yacht would be a sort of occupation for an unmarried man.” “I am really horribly sorry,” began <PER>, in the last stage of bated bewilderment and exasperation, “but really----” “Oh, I can see you can't have it on you at the moment,” said Mr. <PER> with much intellectual magnanimity. “Well, the fact is----” began <PER> again, and then the phrase was frozen on his mouth, for round the corner came the goatlike face and gleaming eye-glasses of Dr. <PER>. “Ah, my dear Mr. <PER>,” said the doctor, as if delighted at a coincidence; “and Mr. <PER>, too. Why, I want to speak to Mr. <PER>.” Mr. <PER> made some movement rather of surrender than assent, and the doctor caught it up exquisitely, showing even more of his <NUM> front teeth. “I am sure Mr. <PER> will excuse us a moment.” And with flying frock-coat he led <PER> rapidly round the corner of a path. “My dear sir,” he said, in a quite affectionate manner, “I do not mind telling you--you are such a very hopeful case--you understand so well the scientific point of view; and I don't like to see you bothered by the really hopeless cases. They are monotonous and maddening. The man you have just been talking to, poor fellow, is one of the strongest cases of pure _idee fixe_ that we have. It's very sad, and I'm afraid utterly incurable. He keeps on telling everybody”--and the doctor lowered his voice confidentially--“he tells everybody that <NUM> people have taken is yacht. His account of how he lost it is quite incoherent.” <PER> stamped his foot on the gravel path, and called out: “Oh, I can't stand this.

For the <NUM> time he made an advance toward his granddaughter. “Come here a minute, <PER>.” He took her hand and led her to his chair, and seating himself, lifted her into his lap. The corners of her lips were drawing down involuntarily, and as her head fell against his broad shoulder, he took out his handkerchief and dried her eyes. “I hope you'll forgive me,” he said. “After this I will always wait for your permission. Now what is this about cousin <PER>?” <PER> shook her head, not trusting herself to speak. “You can't tell me?” “No.” “Then don't you think perhaps it was a good thing I read your letter after all, if it is something I ought to know?” The speaker was not so interested to discover the secrets of his beautiful guest as to set himself right with this admirer. He did not relish falling from his pedestal. “Do you think perhaps Divine Love made you do it, grandpa?” asked the child tremulously, with returning hope. Mr. <PER> was quite certain that it had been curiosity, but he was willing to accept a higher sounding hypothesis. “Mother explained to me about God making 'the wrath of man to praise Him,'” added <ORG> after the moment's pause. “If it makes you kind to cousin <PER>, perhaps we can be glad you read it.” “What is the matter with <PER>?” asked Mr. <PER>. <ORG> sat up, fixed him with her eyes, pressed her lips together, and shook her head. “You won't tell me?” The head went on firmly shaking. “Then let me read the letter again.” “No, grandpa,” decidedly.

These were chiefly old sailors—some of them petty officers—who, presuming upon their age or rank, doubtless thought that, after so many had complied with the Captain’s commands, _they_, being but a handful, would be exempted from compliance, and remain a monument of our master’s clemency. <TIME>, when the drum beat to quarters, the sailors went sullenly to their guns, and the old tars who still sported their beards stood up, grim, defying, and motionless, as the rows of sculptured Assyrian kings, who, with their magnificent beards, have recently been exhumed by <ORG>. When the proper time arrived, their names were taken down by the officers of divisions, and they were afterward summoned in a body to the mast, where the Captain stood ready to receive them. The whole ship’s company crowded to the spot, and, amid the breathless multitude, the venerable rebels advanced and unhatted. It was an imposing display. They were old and venerable <PER>; their cheeks had been burned brown in all latitudes, wherever the sun sends a tropical ray. Reverend old tars, one and all; some of them might have been grandsires, with grandchildren in every port round the world. They ought to have commanded the veneration of the most frivolous or magisterial beholder. Even Captain <PER> they ought to have humiliated into deference.

In his hand was a soiled, inflammatory-looking pamphlet, from which he frequently read; following up the quotations with nervous appeals to his hearers, a rolling of his eyes, and sometimes the most frantic gestures. I was not long within hearing of him, before I became aware that this youth was a Chartist. Presently the crowd increased, and some commotion was raised, when I noticed the police officers augmenting in number; and by and by, they began to glide through the crowd, politely hinting at the propriety of dispersing.

'Let none _even doubt_,' says the author of the Novum Organum, who thought it wisest to steer clear _even_ of _doubt_ on such a point, 'whether we are anxious to destroy and demolish _the philosophical arts and sciences which are now in use_. On the contrary, we readily cherish their practice, cultivation, and honour; for we by no means interfere to prevent _the prevalent system_ from encouraging discussion, adorning discourses, or being employed _serviceably_ in the chair of the Professor, or the practice of common life, and being taken in short, by general consent, _as current coin_.

This is the proof of his sincerity in professing his regard and friendly disposition towards them, to be taken in connection with his works on <ORG>, and no doubt it was sincere, and just to that extent to which these statements, and the practice which was connected with them, would seem to indicate; but the careful reader will perceive that it was a regard, and friendliness of disposition, which was naturally qualified by that doubly significant fact last quoted.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9398120045661926,0.9398120045661926,-3.451695680618286
877,"There must be a High Court of Wit, and a Bench of Peers in that estate of the realm, or ever these treasons could be brought to trial. For it was a mode of communication which involved in its more obvious construction the necessary submission to power. It was the instructed ear,--the ear of a school,--which was required to lend to it its more recondite meanings;--it was the ear of that new school in philosophy which had made History the basis of its learning,--which, dealing with _principles_ instead of _words_, had glanced, not without some nice observation in passing, at their more '_conspicuous_' historical 'INSTANCES';--it was the ear of a school which had everywhere the great historical representations and diagrams at its control, and could substitute, without much hindrance, particulars for generals, or generals for particulars, as the case might be; it was the ear of a school intrusted with discretionary power, but trained and practised in the art of using it. Originally an art of necessity, with practice, in the skilful hands of those who employed it, it came at length to have a charm of its own. In such hands, it became an instrument of literary power, which had not before been conceived of; a medium too of densest ornament, of thick crowding conceits, and nestling beauties, which no style before had ever had depth enough to harbour. It established a new, and more intimate and living relation between the author and his reader,--between the speaker and his audience. There was ever the charm of that secret understanding lending itself to all the effects. It made the reader, or the hearer, participator in the artist's skill, and joint proprietor in the result. The author's own glow must be on his cheek, the author's own flash in his eye, ere that result was possible. The nice point of the skilful pen, the depth of the lurking tone was lost, unless an eye as skilful, or an ear as fine, tracked or waited on it.

881,"No wonder if some new aspects of these ordinary phenomena, these 'common things,' as he calls them, should come out, when they too come to be subjected to a scientific inquiry, and when the Poet of this Advancement, this so subtle Poet of it, begins to explore them.

And it is while he is still undergoing the last extreme of the suffering which the human wrong is capable of inflicting on the affections, that he comes in the Poet's hands to exhibit also the unexplored depth of that wrong,--that monstrous, inhuman social error, that perpetual outrage on nature in her _human_ law, which leaves the helpless human outcast to the rough discipline of nature, which casts him out from the family of man, from its common love and shelter, and leaves him in his vices, and helplessness, and ignorance, to contend alone with great nature and her unrelenting consequences.

Under this course of education, <PER> grew to youth and manhood; and the lovers of good words could only say in his favor, that he was a greater enemy to himself than to any one else, and that, if he should reform, few would have a better chance of prosperity than he. The former clause of this modicum of praise (if praise it may be termed) was indisputable; but it may be doubted, whether, under any circumstances where his success depended on his own exertions, <PER> would have made his way well through the world. He was one of those unfortunate persons, who, instead of being perfect in any single art or occupation, are superficial in many, and who are supposed to possess a larger share of talent than other men, because it consists of numerous scraps, instead of a single mass. He was partially acquainted with most of the manual arts that gave bread to others; but not <NUM> of them, nor all of them, would give bread to him. By some fatality, the <NUM> of his multifarious accomplishments in which his excellence was generally conceded were both calculated to keep him poor rather than to make him rich. He was a musician and a poet. There are yet remaining in that portion of the country many ballads and songs,--set to their own peculiar tunes,--the authorship of which is attributed to him. In general, his productions were upon subjects of local and temporary interest, and would consequently require a bulk of explanatory notes to render them interesting or intelligible to the world at large. A considerable proportion of the remainder are <ORG>; though, in their construction, <PER> imitated neither the Teian nor any other bard. These latter have generally a coarseness and sensuality intolerable to minds even of no very fastidious delicacy. But there are <NUM> simple little songs, into which a feeling and a natural pathos have found their way, that still retain their influence over the heart.

What is it that is missing out of this philosophy? Nothing less than the 'principal' part of it. All that is good for anything in it, according to the author's own estimate. The rest serves merely 'to pass the time,' or it is good as it serves to prepare the way for this. What is it that we have to look for?

The _subject_ itself determines the form, he says; and the fact that the whole ground of the discovery is ground already necessarily comprehended in the preconceptions of the many--that it is ground covered all over with the traditions and rude theories of unlearned ages, this fact, also, imperiously determines the method of the inculcation.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9840148091316223,0.9840148091316223,-0.48571866750717163
909,"A knowledge of the great classical sculpture of <LOC> could not but invest with a new dignity and chastity the notions which so far had been nurtured on the Venus de’ Medici and <ORG>—even <PER> lived and possibly died under their spell. And ‘returning to the nature which had inspired the ancient myths’, the Romantic poets must have felt with a keener sense ‘their exquisite vitality’. The whole tenor of English Romanticism may be said to have been affected thereby. For English Romanticism—and this is one of its most distinctive merits—had no exclusiveness about it. It was too spontaneous, one would almost say, too unconscious, ever to be clannish. It grew, untrammelled by codes, uncrystallized into formulas, a living thing always, not a subject-matter for grandiloquent manifestoes and more or less dignified squabbles. It could therefore absorb and turn to account elements which seemed antagonistic to it in the more sophisticated forms it assumed in other literatures. Thus, whilst French Romanticism—in spite of what it may or may not have owed to <PER>—became often distinctly, deliberately, wilfully anti-classical, whilst for example <PER> in that all-comprehending _Légende des Siècles_ could find room for the <LOC> and for <PER>, but did not consecrate a single line to the departed glories of mythical <LOC>, the Romantic poets of <LOC> may claim to have restored in freshness and purity the religion of antiquity. Indeed their voice was so convincing that even the great Christian chorus that broke out afresh in the Victorian era could not entirely drown it, and <PER> had an apologetic way of dismissing ‘the dead Pan’, and all the ‘vain false gods of <LOC>’, with an acknowledgement of your beauty which confesses Some chief Beauty conquering you. This may be taken to have been the average attitude, in the forties, towards classical mythology. <DATE> before, at least in the <PER> circle, it was far less grudging, we now have definite proof. Not only was <PER> prepared to admit, with the liberal opinion of the time, that ancient mythology ‘was a system of nature concealed under the veil of allegory’, a system in which <NUM> fanciful fables contained a secret and mystic meaning’: he was prepared to go a considerable step farther, and claim that there was no essential difference between ancient mythology and the theology of the Christians, that both were interpretations, in more or less figurative language, of the great mysteries of being, and indeed that the earlier interpretation, precisely because it was more frankly figurative and poetical than <DATE>, was better fitted to stimulate and to allay the sense of wonder which ought to accompany a reverent and high-souled man throughout his life-career.",unknown,OscarWilde,0.9940280914306641,0.9940280914306641,-0.315560519695282
910,"The author of this volume had not sought to put any but the ordinary and obvious interpretation upon his works, nor to take any other view of his character than what accorded with the unanimous judgment upon it of all the generations since his epoch. But, as she penetrated more and more deeply into the plays, and became aware of those inner readings, she found herself compelled to turn back to <ORG> for information as to their plan and purport; and Lord Bacon's <ORG> failed not to give her what she sought; thus adding to the immortal dramas, in her idea, a far higher value than their warmest admirers had heretofore claimed for them. They filled out the scientific scheme which <ORG> had planned, and which needed only these profound and vivid illustrations of human life and character to make it perfect. Finally, the author's researches led her to a point where she found the plays claimed for <PER> and his associates,--not in a way that was meant to be intelligible in their own perilous times,--but in characters that only became legible, and illuminated, as it were, in the light of a subsequent period. The reader will soon perceive that the new philosophy, as here demonstrated, was of a kind that no professor could have ventured openly to teach in <DATE> of <PER> and <PER>. The concluding chapter of the present work makes a powerful statement of the position which a man, conscious of great and noble aims, would then have occupied; and shows, too, how familiar the age was with all methods of secret communication, and of hiding thought beneath a masque of conceit or folly. Applicably to this subject, I quote a paragraph from a manuscript of the author's, not intended for present publication:-- 'It was a time when authors, who treated of a scientific politics and of a scientific ethics internally connected with it, naturally preferred this more philosophic, symbolic method of indicating their connection with their writings, which would limit the indication to those who could <PER> within the veil of a philosophic symbolism.

Within a few feet of him at <NUM> corner of the square of standing people stood the girl he had known in <LOC>, <PER>.

Her square face and throat were thrown back, as her habit was, and there was something almost sleepy in the geniality of her eyes. He saw her <NUM>, and for <TIME> saw her only; then the outer edge of his eyesight took in all the other staring faces, and he saw all the faces he had ever seen for <DATE> and <DATE>. There was the Tolstoyan in Jaeger flannel, with the yellow beard that went backward and the foolish nose and eyes that went forward, with the curiosity of a crank.

His labors finally sifted down to the unearthing of a late novel from a drawer at his right hand, and lowering a convenient, green-shaded electric light, he lit his cigar, and was soon lost in the pages of the story. At last he became conscious that the pencil at the table had ceased to move, and lowering his book he looked up. His granddaughter had been watching for this happy event, and she no sooner met his eyes than, with a smile of satisfaction, she jumped from her <LOC> perch and brought him a sheet of paper well and laboriously covered. “I suppose it isn't all spelled right,” she said. “I didn't want to disturb you to ask; but will you please direct this to Dr. <PER>?” “To Dr. <PER>!” repeated Mr. <PER>.

He cast a curious glance at the little girl as he left the barn. He had received his mother's version of <DATE>'s experience. “Well, it looks to me as if there was something those <ORG> folks know that the rest of us don't,” he soliloquized. “I saw her with my own eyes, and felt her with my own hands.

He lifted her into the saddle and arranged her skirt, brushing away the dust. “<PER>!” she exclaimed softly, with a long, quivering sigh, “I'm so _happy_!” “Have you ever ridden, <PER>?” “Oh, yes, <NUM> times,” she answered quickly; “but not on a real horse,” she added as an afterthought. “H'm.

929,"Nothing almost sees MIRACLES _but_ MISERY, says poor <PER>, in the stocks, waiting for the 'beacon' of the morning, by whose _comfortable_ beams, he might peruse his letter. 'I know,' he says, ''<PER> from <PER>, Who hath most fortunately been informed Of my obscured course, and shall find _time From this enormous state_--seeking--TO GIVE LOSSES THEIR REMEDIES.' There is no attempt to demonstrate that the work here proposed as a study, worthy the attention of the philosophical student, is not, notwithstanding a Poem, and a Poet's gift, not to his contemporaries only, but to his kind. What is claimed is, indeed, that it is a Poem which, with all its overpowering theatrical effects, does, in fact, reserve its true poetic wealth, for those who will find the springs of its inmost philosophic purport. There is no attempt to show that this play belongs to the category of scientific works, according to our present limitation of the term, or that there could be found any niche for it, on those lower platforms and compartments of the new science of nature, which our modern works of natural science occupy. It was inevitably a Poem. There was the essence of all Tragedy in the purely scientific exhibition, which the purpose of it required. The intention of the Poet to exhibit the radical idea of his plot impressively, so as to reach the popular mind through its appeal to the sensibilities, involved, of course, the finest series of conjunctions of artistic effects, the most exquisite characterization, the boldest grouping, the most startling and determined contrasts, which the whole range of his art could furnish. But that which is only the incident of a genuine poetic inspiration, the effect upon the senses, which its higher appeals are sure to involve, becomes with those delighting in, and capable of appreciating, that sensuous effect merely, its sufficient and only end, and even a doctrine of criticism based on this inversion will not be wanting. But the difficulty of unlocking the great <LOC> poems with any such theory of Art, arises from the fact that it is not the theory of Art, which the great Elizabethan Poets adopted, and whether we approve of theirs or not, we must take it, such as it was, for our torch in this exploration.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9846797585487366,0.9846797585487366,-0.4520093500614166

But as to the authority for these readings, <PER> himself will give us that; for this is the style which he discriminates so sharply as 'the _enigmatical_,' a style which he, too, finds to have been in use among the ancients, and which he tells us _has some affinity_ with that new method of making over knowledge from the mind of the teacher to that of the pupil, which he terms the method of _progression_-- (which is the method of _<DATE> opposition to the received method, the only method he finds in use, which he, too, calls the _magisterial_.

In this case, he tells us it is necessary for the teacher to descend to _the foundations of knowledge and consent_, and so to transplant it into another as it grew in his own mind, 'whereas as knowledge is now delivered, there is a _kind of contract of error_ between the deliverer and the receiver, for he that delivereth knowledge <PER> to deliver it in such a form as may _best be believed_, and not as may best be _examined_: and he that receiveth knowledge <PER> rather _present satisfaction_ than _expectant inquiry_, and so rather _not to doubt than not to err, glory_ making the author not to lay open his weakness, and _sloth_ making the disciple _not to know his strength_.'

931,"By some singular oversight or caprice of tyranny, or on account of some fastidious scruple of the imagination perhaps, it does _not_ appear, indeed, to have been the fashion, either in the reigns of the <LOC> or the <PER>, to pluck out the living human eye as <ORG>'s eyes were plucked out; and that of itself would have furnished a reason why this poor duke should have been compelled to submit to that particular operation, instead of presenting himself to have his ears cut off in a sober, decent, civilized, Christian manner; or to have them grubbed out, if it happened that the operation had been once performed already; or to have his hand cut off, or his head, with his eyes in it; or to be roasted alive some <DATE> in the public square, eyes and all, as many an honest gentleman was expected to present himself in those times, without making any particular demur or fuss about it. _These_ were operations that Englishmen of every rank and profession, soldiers, scholars, poets, philosophers, lawyers, physicians, and grave and reverend divines, were called on to undergo in those times, and for that identical offence of which <ORG> stood convicted, opposition to the will of a lawless usurping tyranny,--to its merest caprice of vanity or humour, perhaps,--or on grounds slighter still, on bare suspicion of a disposition to oppose it.

937,"All the religious wars, the private feuds, and the countless miseries of sectarian contention, would have been at least minimised, if not avoided, had the bare example of Christ's life been adopted as the standard of conduct and of religion.

THAT is the hall-mark of the true follower of Christ, and not the mute acceptance of doctrines which are, upon the face of them, false and pernicious, because they come to us with some show of authority. What authority have we now, save this very life, which could compare with those Jewish books which were so binding in their force, and so immutably sacred that even the misspellings or pen-slips of the scribe, were most carefully preserved? It is a simple obvious fact that if Christ had been orthodox, and had possessed what is so often praised as a ""child-like faith,"" there could have been no such thing as Christianity. Let reformers who love Him take heart as they consider that they are indeed following in the footsteps of the Master, who has at no time said that the revelation which He brought, and which has been so imperfectly used, is the last which will come to mankind.

944,"How to dispatch in the most agreeable and successful manner, creatures whose notions of _good_ are constitutionally and diametrically opposed to the good of the larger whole, who have no sensibility to that, and no faculty whereby they perceive it to be the worthier; that is no doubt <NUM> part of the problem. The scientific question is, whether this creature be really what it seems, a new and more horrid kind of beast--a demoralization and deterioration of the human species into that. If it be, let our naturalists come to our aid here also, and teach us how to hunt him down and despatch him, with as much respect to the natural decencies which the fact of the external human form would seem still to exact from us, as the circumstances will admit of. Is it the beast, or is it 'the fiend?' --that is the question. The fiend which tells us that the angelic or divine nature is there--there still--overborne, trampled on, '_as it were_, annihilated,' but lighting that gleam of 'wickedness,'--making of it, not instinct, but crime. Ah! we need not ask which it is. This one has told his own story, if we could but read it. He has left--he is leaving all the time, contributions, richest contributions to our natural history of man,--that history which must make the basis of our arts of cure. He was a wolf when you took him; but in his cell you found something else in him--did you not?--something that troubled and appalled you, with its kindred and likeness, and its exaction on your sympathy. When you hung him as you would _not_ hang a dog;--when you put him to a death which you would think it indecent and inhuman to award to a creature of another species, you did not find him _that_.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9780358672142029,0.9780358672142029,-0.7285545468330383
945,"And the Poet himself has large and gentle views of 'this particular,' scientific views of it, scientific recognitions of its laws, such as no philosophic school was ever before able to pronounce. Even here, on this sad and tragic ground of a subdued and debased common-weal, he will not cramp its utterance--he will give it leave to speak, in all its tenderness and beauty, in its own sweet native dialect, all its poetic wildness, its mad verities, its sober impossibilities, even at the moment in which he asks in statesmanship for the rational motive, undrenched in humours and affections--for the motive of the weal that is common, and not for the motive of that which is private and exclusive. In vain the hero struggles with his yielding passion, and seeks to retain it. In vain he struggles with a sentiment which he himself describes as 'a <PER>'s instinct,' and seeks to subdue it. In vain he rallies his pride, and says, 'Let it be _virtuous_ to be _obstinate_'; and determines to stand 'as if a man were author of himself, and knew no other kin.' His mother kneels. It is but a frail, aged woman kneeling to the victorious chieftain of the Volscian hosts; but to him it is 'as if _<ORG>_ to _a <ORG>_ stooped in supplication.' His boy looks at him with an eye in which great Nature speaks, and says, 'Deny not'; he sees the tears in the dove's eyes of the beloved, he hears her dewy voice; we hear it, too, through the Poet's art, in the words she speaks; and he forgets his part. We reach the 'grub' once more. The dragon wings of armies melt from him. He is his young boy's father--he is his fair young wife's beloved. 'O a kiss, long _as_ my exile, sweet _as_ my revenge.' There's no decision yet. The scales are even now. But there is another there, waiting to be saluted, and he himself is but a boy--his own mother's boy again, at her feet. It is she that schools and lessons him; it is she that conquers him. It _was_ 'her boy,' after all--it was her boy still, that was 'coming home.'

It is this science of NATURE IN GENERAL which makes the SCIENCE of _Human Nature_ for the <NUM> time possible; and that is the end and term of the new <ORG> the inventor of it tells us. And the moment that he comes in with that new torch, which he has been out into 'the continent of nature' to light,--the moment that he comes back with it, into this old debateable ground of the schools, and begins to apply it to that element in the human life in which the scientific innovation appears to be chiefly demanded, 'most of the controversies,' as he tells us very simply--'most of the controversies, wherein moral philosophy is conversant, are judged and determined by it.' But here is the bold and startling criticism with which he commences his approach to this subject; here is the ground which he makes at the <NUM> step; this is the ground of his scientific innovation; not less important than this, is the field which he finds unoccupied. In the handling of this science he says, (the science of 'the Appetite and Will of Man'), 'those which have written seem to me to have done as if a man that _professed to teach to write_ did only exhibit _fair copies_ of alphabets _and_ letters joined, without giving any precepts or directions for the carriage of the hand, or the framing of the letters; so have they made good and fair _exemplars_ and _copies_, carrying the _draughts_ and _portraitures_ of _good, virtue, duty, felicity_; propounding them, well described, as the true _objects_ and _scopes_ of man's will and designs; _but how to attain these excellent marks_, and _how_ to _frame_ and _subdue_ the _will_ of _man_ to become _true_ and _conformable_ to _these pursuits_, they _pass it over altogether_, or slightly and _unprofitably_; for it is not,' he says, 'certain scattered glances and touches that can excuse the _absence_ of this _part_ of--SCIENCE.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9710501432418823,0.9710501432418823,-1.0656089782714844
982,"And the ceremony, which made <PER> a landholder, a householder, and a substantial man, in due time took place. As a landlord, his general conduct was very praiseworthy. He was moderate in his charges, and attentive to his guests; he allowed no gross and evident disorders in his house, and practised none himself; he was kind and charitable to such as needed food and lodging, and had not wherewithal to pay,--for with these his experience had doubtless given him a fellow-feeling. He was also sufficiently attentive to his wife; though it must be acknowledged that the religious zeal which had had a considerable influence in gaining her affections grew, by no moderate degrees, less fervent. It was whispered, too, that the new landlord could, when time, place, and company were to his mind, upraise a song as merrily, and drink a glass as jollily, as in <DATE> of yore. These were the weightiest charges that could now be brought against him; and wise men thought, that, whatever might have been the evil of his past life, he had returned with a desire (which <DATE> of vice, if they do not sometimes produce, do not always destroy) of being honest, if opportunity should offer; and <PER> had certainly a fair one. On <TIME> previous to the events related in the last chapter, the personage whose introduction to the reader has occupied so large a space was seated under one of the elms in front of his dwelling. The bench which now sustained him, and on which were carved the names of many former occupants, was <PER> favorite lounging-place, unless when his attentions were required by his guests. No demand had that day been made upon the hospitality of the <ORG> and <PER>; and the landlord was just then murmuring at the unfrequency of employment. The slenderness of his profits, indeed, were no part of his concern; for the <PER> chief income was drawn from her farm, nor was <PER> ever miserly inclined. But his education and habits had made him delight in the atmosphere of the <LOC>, and in the society of those who frequented it; and of this species of enjoyment his present situation certainly did not afford an overplus. Yet had <PER> an enviable appearance of indolence and ease, as he sat under the old tree, polluting the sweet air with his pipe, and taking occasional draughts from a brown jug that stood near at hand. The basis of the potation contained in this vessel was harsh old cider, from the widow's own orchard; but its coldness and acidity were rendered innocuous by a due proportion of yet older brandy.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9829203486442566,0.9829203486442566,-0.4591723680496216
986,"For it is in this scene, that the outcast king encounters the victim of tyranny, whose eyes have been plucked out, and who has been turned out to beggary, as the penalty of having come athwart that disposition in 'the duke,' that 'all the world well knows will not be rubbed or stopped';--it is in this scene that <ORG> finds him smelling his way to _<LOC>_, for that is the name in the play--the play name--for the place towards which men's hopes appear to be turning; and that conversation as to how the world goes, to which allusion has been already made, comes off, without appearing to suggest to any mind, that it is other than accidental on the part of the Poet, or that the action of the play might possibly be connected with it! For notwithstanding this great stress, which he lays everywhere on _forethought_ and a deliberative _rational_ intelligent procedure, as _the distinctive human mark_,--the characteristic feature of _a man_,--the poor poet himself, does not appear to have gained much credit hitherto for the possession of this human quality.-- _<ORG>_.

She looked up. “Why, somebody married you, Mrs. <PER>,” she said kindly. Mr. <PER>'s paper hid a face which suddenly contorted, but the housekeeper's quick-glancing eyes could not see a telltale motion.

989,"And that there may be no difficulty or mistake as to the reading of that passage, he immediately adds, 'In the enumeration of these private and retired arts, it may be thought I _seek to make a great muster-roll of sciences_, naming them for _show_ and _ostentation_, and _to little other purpose_. But'--note it--'But, let those which are _skilful in them judge, whether I bring them in only for appearance_, or whether, in that which I speak of them, though in few words, there be not _some seed of proficience_. And this must be remembered, that as there be many of great account in their countries and provinces, which, when they come up to the _seat of the estate_, are but of mean rank, and scarcely regarded; so these arts, (""these private and retired arts,"") being here placed _with the principal and <ORG>, seem_ petty things, YET TO SUCH AS HAVE CHOSEN THEM TO SPEND THEIR LABOURS AND STUDIES IN THEM, THEY SEEM GREAT MATTERS.

990,"So we must not be surprised to find that this author who writes under such liabilities ventures to bring out the pith of his trunk of sciences,--that which sciences have in common,--the doctrine of the nature of things,--what he calls '_prima philosophia_,' when his learned sock is on--a little more strongly and fully in that branch of it, with a glance this way, with a distinct intimation that it is common to the <NUM>, and applies here as well. There, too, he complains of the ignorance of anatomy, which is just the complaint he has been making here, and that, for want of it, 'they quarrel many times with the humours which are not in fault, the fault being in the very frame and mechanic of the part, which cannot be removed by medicine _alterative_, but must be _accommodated_ and palliated by diet and medicines _familiar_.' There, too, he reports the lack of medicinal history, and gives directions for supplying it, just such directions as he gives here, but that which makes the astounding difference in the reading of these reports to-day, is, that the one has been accepted, and the other has not; nay, that the one has been _read_, and the other has not: for how else can we account for the fact, that men of learning, in our time, come out and tell us deliberately, not merely that this man's place in history, is the place of one who devoted his genius to the promotion of the personal convenience and bodily welfare of men, but, that it is the place of one who gave up the nobler nature, deliberately, on principle, and after examination and reflection, as a thing past help from science, as a thing lying out of the range of philosophy?",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9585043787956238,0.9585043787956238,-1.5449926853179932
993,"And without making any claim on his behalf, which it would be unworthy to make for one to whom the truth was dearer than the opinions of men; it may be asserted, that whatever errors of judgment or passion, we may find, or think we find in him, these ends were with him predominant, and shaped his course. He was not naturally a man of _letters_, but a man of action, intensely impelled to action, and it was because he was forbidden to fulfil his enterprise in person, because he had to write letters of direction to those to whom he was compelled to entrust it, because he had to write letters to the future, and leave himself and his will in letters, that letters became, in his hands, _practical_. He, too, knew what it was to be compelled 'to unpack his heart in words' when deeds should have expressed it. But even words are forbidden him here. After all the pains he has taken to show us what the deficiency is which he is reporting here, and what the art and science which he is proposing, he can only put down a few paragraphs on the subject, casually, as it were, in passing. Of all these forces which have operation on the mind, and with which scientific appliances for the human mind should be compounded, he can only 'insist upon some one or <NUM> as an example of the rest.'

But a writer who had the advantage of being already defunct--a writer whose estate on the earth was then already done, and who was in no kind of danger of losing either his head or his place, could of course manage this part of the subject differently. _He_ would not find it too long to prosecute all, perhaps. And if he had at the same time the advantage of a foreign name and seignorie, he could come out in <LOC> at this very crisis with the freest exhibitions of the points which are _here_ only _indicated_.

Whoever only proposes to himself to remove that which offends _him_, falls short; _for good_ does not necessarily succeed evil; another evil may succeed, _and a worse, as it happened in Caesar's killers_, who brought the republic to _such a pass, that they had reason to repent their meddling with it_.'

1027,"For the helplessness of the human creature in his struggle with the elements, and those conditions of his nature which put him so hopelessly at the mercy of his own kind and kindred, seem to suggest to the royal sufferer, who has the advantage of a fresh experience to stimulate his apprehension, that there ought to be some relief for the human condition from _this source_, that is, from PHILOSOPHY; and his inquiries and discoveries are all stamped with the unmistakeable impress of that fire new philosophy, which was not yet out of the mint elsewhere--which was yet undergoing the formative process in the mind of its great inventor;--that philosophy, which we are told elsewhere 'has for its principal object, to make _nature subservient to the wants and state of Man_';--and which concerns itself for that purpose with ideas as they exist in nature, as _causes_, and not as they exist in the mind of man as _words_ merely.

1029,"The brown cheeks and the rustic dress of some would inform him that they had but recently left the plough to labor in a not less toilsome field; the grave look, and the intermingling of garments of a more classic cut, would distinguish those who had begun to acquire the polish of their new residence; and the air of superiority, the paler cheek, the less robust form, the spectacles of green, and the dress, in general of threadbare black, would designate the highest class, who were understood to have acquired nearly all the science their Alma Mater could bestow, and to be on the point of assuming their stations in the world. There were, it is true, exceptions to this general description. A few young men had found their way hither from the distant seaports; and these were the models of fashion to their rustic companions, over whom they asserted a superiority in exterior accomplishments, which the fresh though unpolished intellect of the sons of the forest denied them in their literary competitions. A <NUM> class, differing widely from both the former, consisted of a few young descendants of the aborigines, to whom an impracticable philanthropy was endeavoring to impart the benefits of civilization.

But it makes a new style in literature, when such men as these, excluded from their natural sphere of activity, get driven into books, cornered into paragraphs, and compelled to unpack their hearts in letters. There is a new tone to the words spoken under such compression. It is a tone that the school and the cloister never rang with,--it is one that the fancy dealers in letters are not able to deal in.

The only thing that could be done in such circumstances was, to _translate_ their doctrine into the language of their time. They must take the current terms--the vague popular terms--as they found them, and restrict and enlarge them, and inform them with their new meanings, with a hint to 'men of understanding' as to the sense in which they use them.

I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure. “Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other.

Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed.

He takes pains to notice, also, that a representation, by means of these 'transient hieroglyphics,' is much more moving to the sensibilities, and leaves a more vivid and durable impression on the memory, than the most eloquent statement in mere words. 'What is _sensible_ always strikes the memory more strongly, and sooner impresses itself, than what is _intellectual_. Thus the memory of _brutes_ is excited by sensible, but not by intellectual things;' and thus, also, he proposes to impress that _class_ which <LOC> speaks of, 'whose eyes are more learned than their ears,' to whom 'action is eloquence.' Here we have the advantage of the combination, for there is no part of the dumb show, but has its word of scientific comment and interpretation. 'Art cold ? I am cold myself. _Where is this_ STRAW, _my fellow_? The art of our necessities is strange, That can make vile things _precious_. Come, _your hovel_. Come, bring us to this _hovel_.' For this is what that wild tragic poetic resistance and defiance comes to--this is what the 'unaccommodated man' comes to, though it is the highest person in the state, stripped of his ceremonies and artificial appliances, on whom the experiment is tried.

The results which have since been obtained by the use of this method in that department of philosophy to which it is specially applied in the Novum Organum, give to the inquirer into the causes of the physical phenomena now, some advantages which no invention could supply them.

It is the relation of the spirit of military conquest, the relation of the military hero, and his government, to the true human need, which is subjected to criticism here; a criticism which is necessarily an after-thought in the natural order of the human development. The transition 'from the casque to the cushion,' that so easy step in <DATE>, whether it be 'an entrance by conquest,' foreign or otherwise, or whether the chieftain's own followers bring him home in triumph, and the people, whose battle he has won, conduct him to their chair of state, in either case, that transition appears, to this author's eye, worth going back, and looking into a little, in an age so advanced in civilization, as the one in which he finds himself. For though he is, as any one who will take any pains to inquire, may easily satisfy himself,--the master in chief of the new science of nature,--and the deepest in its secrets of any, his views on that subject appear to be somewhat broader, his aspirations altogether of another kind, from those, to which his school have since limited themselves. He does not content himself with pinning butterflies and hunting down beetles; his scientific curiosity is not satisfied with classifying ferns and lichens, and ascertaining the proper historical position of pudding-stone and sand-stone, and in settling the difference between them and their neighbours. Nature is always, in all her varieties wonderful, and all 'her infinite book of secrecy,' that book which all the world had overlooked till he came, was to his eye, from the <NUM>, a book of spells, of magic lore, a <PER> book of enchantments.

He is of the opinion that some subjects are nobler than others, and that those which concern specially the human kind, have a special claim to their regard, and the secret of those combinations which result in the varieties of shell-fish, and other similar orders of being, do _not_ exclusively, or chiefly, engage his attention.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.8787717223167419,0.8787717223167419,-3.9464759826660156
1105,"<ORG> and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure. By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed <DATE> in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart! Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud. But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an <TIME>’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after <DATE>’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me. But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9861094355583191,0.9861094355583191,-0.2133505642414093
1107,"The concrete is very carefully guarded there against that 'pernicious habit'; it is saved at the expense of the human species, at the expense of its arrogance. Nobody need undertake to abstract _those_ laws, whatever they may be, for this master has turned his key on them. They are in their proper place; they are in the things themselves, and cannot be taken out of them. The utmost that you can do is to attain to a scientific knowledge of them, one that exactly corresponds with them. That _correspondence_ is the point in the new metaphysics, and in the new logic;--_that_ was what was wanting in the old. 'The investigation, discovery, and development of this law, in _every branch of learning_, are the foundation both of theory and practice. This law, therefore, and its _parallel_ in each science, is what _we_ understand by the term FORM.' The distinction is very carefully made between the 'cause in nature,' and that which _corresponds_ to it, in the human mind, the _parallel_ to it in the sciences; for the notions of men and the notions of nature are extremely apt to differ when the mind is left to form its notions without any scientific rule or instrument; and these ill-made abstractions, which do not correspond with the cause in nature, are of no efficacy in the arts, for nature takes no notice of them whatever. There is <NUM> term in use here which represents at the same time the cause in nature, and that which corresponds to it in the mind of man--the parallel to it in the sciences. When these _exactly correspond_, <NUM> term suffices. The term 'FORM' is preferred for that purpose in this school. The term which was applied to the abstractions of the old philosophy, with a little modification, is made to signalise the difference between the old and the new. The 'IDEAS' of the old philosophy, the hasty abstractions of it, are '_the idols_' of the new--the false deceiving images--which must be destroyed ere that which is fixed and constant _in nature_ can establish its own parallels in our learning. 'Too untimely a departure, and too remote a recess from particulars,' is the cause briefly assigned in this criticism for this want of correspondence hitherto. 'But it is manifest that <PER>, in his opinion of _ideas_, as one that had a wit of elevation situate as upon a cliff, did descry that forms were the true object of knowledge, but lost the real fruit of that opinion by considering of forms as absolutely abstracted from matter, and not _confined_ and _determined_ by matter.'",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9755034446716309,0.9755034446716309,-1.0847415924072266

All that time there was a cloud on his political horizon--'a huge one, a black one'--slowly and steadfastly accumulating, and rolling up from it, which he had always an eye on. He knew there was that in it which no scientific apparatus that could be put in operation then, on so short a notice, and when science was so feebly aided, would be able to divert or conduct entirely. He knew that so fearful a war-cloud would have to burst, and get overblown, before any chance for those peace operations, those operations of a solid and lasting peace, which he was bent on, could be had--before any space on the earth could be found broad enough for his Novum Organum to get to work on, before the central levers of it could begin to stir. That revolution which 'was singing in the wind' then to his ear, was one which would have to come <NUM> in the chronological order; but it was easy enough to see that it was not going to be such a one, in all respects, as a man of his turn of genius would care to be out in with his works.

In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the <NUM> creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue. “Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to <LOC>, you will have little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion. “That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, <TIME>, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for <DATE>.

He paused, he stammered, he caught his breath between the words, and he blurted out in little blunt phrases all the hopes of his heart. If love had not come to her yet, there was at least pity and sympathy, which are nearly akin to it. Wonder there was also that one so weak and frail as she should shake this strong man so, should have the whole course of his life waiting for her decision. Her left hand was on the cushion at her side. He leaned forward and took it gently in his own. She did not try to draw it back from him. ""May I have it,"" said he, ""for life?""

1129,"The Yeoman of the <PER> was a somewhat odd specimen of a <PER>. He was a little old man, round-shouldered, bald-headed, with great goggle-eyes, looking through portentous round spectacles, which he called his _barnacles_. He was imbued with a wonderful zeal for the naval service, and seemed to think that, in keeping his pistols and cutlasses free from rust, he preserved the national honour untarnished. After _general quarters_, it was amusing to watch his anxious air as the various _petty officers_ restored to him the arms used at the martial exercises of the crew. As successive bundles would be deposited on his counter, he would count over the pistols and cutlasses, like an old housekeeper telling over her silver forks and spoons in a pantry before retiring for <TIME>. And often, with a sort of dark lantern in his hand, he might be seen poking into his furthest vaults and cellars, and counting over his great coils of ropes, as if they were all jolly puncheons of old <LOC>. By reason of his incessant watchfulness and unaccountable bachelor oddities, it was very difficult for him to retain in his employment the various sailors who, from time to time, were billeted with him to do the duty of subalterns. In particular, he was always desirous of having <NUM> steady, faultless young man, of a literary taste, to keep an eye to his account-books, and swab out the armoury <TIME>. It was an odious business this, to be immured <DATE> in such a bottomless hole, among tarry old ropes and villainous guns and pistols. It was with peculiar dread that I one day noticed the goggle-eyes of _Old Revolver_, as they called him, fastened upon me with a fatal glance of good-will and approbation. He had somehow heard of my being a very learned person, who could both read and write with extraordinary facility; and moreover that I was a rather reserved youth, who kept his modest, unassuming merits in the background. But though, from the keen sense of my situation as a man-of-war’s-man all this about my keeping myself in the _back_ ground was true enough, yet I had no idea of hiding my diffident merits _under_ ground. I became alarmed at the old <PER>’s goggling glances, lest he should drag me down into tarry perdition in his hideous store-rooms.

Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.

I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.

1142,"'_But_ since our method of interpretation, after preparing and arranging a history, does not content itself with examining _the opinions and desires_ of THE MIND----like common logic, but also inspects THE NATURE of THINGS, we so regulate the mind that it may be enabled to _apply itself_, in every respect, correctly to _that nature_.'

1148,"Except from this height of a _common nature_, there is no such thing as a scientific explanation of these phenomena possible.

And the knowledge of this nature which is formed in everything, and not in man only, is the beginning, not of a speculative science of the human nature merely,--it is the beginning,--it is the indispensable foundation of the arts in which a successful artistic advancement of that nature, or an artistic cure or culture of it is propounded. The fact that the 'human nature' is, indeed, what it is called, a '_nature_,' the fact that the human species is _a species_,--the fact that the human kind is but a _kind_, neighboured with many others from which it is isolated by its native walls of ignorance,--neighboured with many others, more or less known, known and unknown, more or less _kind_-ly, more or less hostile,--species, kinds, whose dialects of the universal laws, man has not found,--the fact that the universal, historic principles are operant in all the specific modifications of human nature, and control and determine them, the fact that the human life admits of a scientific analysis, and that its phenomena require to be traced to their true forms,--this is the fact which is the key to the new philosophy,--the key which unlocks it,--the key to the part speculative, and the part operative of it.

1153,"The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly. I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the wide <LOC> and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out <TIME> and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings.

This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it. <TIME> passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers.

1155,"Whether the Ancients used those fables for purposes of innovation, and gradual encroachment on error or not, here is a Modern, he tells us, who for one, cannot dispense with them in _his_ teaching. For having disposed of his _graver_ readers--those of the dull and phlegmatic kind--in the preceding paragraph, and not thinking it worth exactly that kind of trouble it would have cost then to make himself more explicit for the sake of reaching _their_ apprehension, he proceeds to the following argument, which is not wanting in clearness for 'those who happen to be of his ear.' 'Men have proposed to answer <NUM> different and contrary ends by the use of Parables, for parables serve as well to instruct and illustrate, as to wrap up and envelope:' [and what is more, they serve at once that double purpose] 'so that for _the present we drop the concealed use_, and suppose the _ancient fables_ to be vague undeterminate things _formed for amusement, still the other use must remain_, and can never be given up. And every man of any learning must readily allow that THIS METHOD of INSTRUCTION is grave, sober, exceedingly useful, and _sometimes necessary in the sciences_, as it opens an easy and familiar passage to the human understanding, IN ALL NEW DISCOVERIES that are abstruse and _out of the road of vulgar opinion_. Hence, in <DATE>, when such inventions and conclusions of the human reason as are _now_ trite and common, were rare and little known, all things abounded with fables, parables, similes, comparisons, allusions, which were not intended to _conceal_, but to _inform and teach_, whilst the minds of men continued rude and unpractised in matters of subtlety and speculation, and even impatient, and in a manner _incapable of receiving such things as did not directly fall under and strike the senses_.' [And <DATE> were not gone by, it seems, for these are the very men of whom Hamlet speaks, 'who for the most part are capable of nothing but _inexplicable dumb-shows_ and _noise_.'] 'For as hieroglyphics were in use before writings, so were parables in use _before argument_. _And even to <DATE>_, if any man would let NEW LIGHT IN upon the human understanding, and _conquer prejudices without raising animosities_, OPPOSITION, or DISTURBANCE----he _must still_----he _must still go in the same path_, and have recourse _to the like method_.'

1156,"To other eyes, it is but a group of Roman ladies, <NUM> or <NUM>, clad in mourning, with their attendants, and a prattling child with them; but, with the <NUM> glance at it from afar, the great chieftain trembles, and begins to clasp his armour. He could think of them and doom them, in his over-mastering passion of revenge, with its heroic infinity of mastery triumphant in him,--he could _think_ of them and doom them; but the impressions of _the senses_ are more vivid, and the passions wait on them. As that group draws nearer, one sees, by the light of this Poet's painting, a fair young matron, with subdued mien and modest graces, and an elder one, leading a wilful boy, with a 'confirmed countenance,' pattering by her side; just such a group as one might see anywhere in the lordly streets of Palatinus,--much such a one as one might find anywhere under those <NUM>-doomed plebeian roofs.

His reasons of state begin to falter, and change their aspects, as that little party draws nearer; and he finds himself within its magnetic sphere. For this is the pattern-man, for the man of mere impression and instinct. He is full of feeling within his sphere, though it is a sphere which does not embrace plebeians,--which crushes Volscians with clarions, and drums, and trumpets, and poets' voices to utter its exultations. Within that private sphere, his sensibilities are exquisite and poetic in their depth and delicacy. He is not wanting in the finer impulses, in the nobler affections of the particular and private nature. He is not a base, brutal man. Even in his martial conquests, he will not take 'leaden spoons.' His soul is with a divine ambition fired to have _all_. It is instinct, but it is the instinct of the human; it is 'conservation with _advancement_' that he is blindly pursuing, for this is a generous nature.

This is the Poet of the Woods; but he is a woodman, he carries an axe on his shoulder. He will wake a continental forest with it and subdue it, and fill it with his music. For this is the Poet who cries 'Westward Ho!' But he has not got into the woods yet in this play. He is only on the edge of them as yet. It is under the blue roof of that same dome which is 'too high,' the princess here says, to belong to the pygmy that this Philosopher likes so well to bring out and to measure under that canopy--it is 'out of doors' that this new speech on behalf of a new learning is spoken. But there is a close rim of conventionalities about us still. It is _a Park_ that this audacious proposal is uttered in. But nothing can be more orderly, for it is 'a Park with a <ORG> in it.' There it is, in the background. If it were the Attic proscenium itself hollowed into the south-east corner of the <LOC>, what more could one ask. But it is the palace of the King of--_Navarre_, who is the prince of good fellows and the prince of good learning at one and the same time, which makes, in this case, the novelty. 'A Park with a <ORG> in it' makes the <NUM> scene. 'Another part of the same' with the pavilion of a princess and the tents of _her_ Court seen in the distance, makes the <NUM>; and the change from <NUM> part of this park to another, though we get into the heart of it sometimes, is the utmost license that the rigours of the Greek Drama permit the Poet to think of at present. This criticism on the old learning, this audacious proposal for the new, with all the bold dramatic illustration with which it is enforced, must be managed here under these restrictions. Whatever 'persons' the plot of this drama may require for its evolutions, whatever witnesses and reporters the trial and conviction of the old learning, and the definition of the ground of the new, may require, will have to be induced to cross this park at this particular time, because the form of the new art is not yet emancipated, and <ORG> cannot stir from the spot to search them out. However, that does not impair the representation as it is managed.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9935978651046753,0.9935978651046753,-1.7902454137802124
1177,"It is a more artistic use of speech that he is proposing in his new science of it, for as Lord Bacon has it, who writes as we shall see on this same subject, 'the _proofs_ and _persuasions_ of _rhetoric_ ought to differ according to the auditors,' and <ORG> have for their legitimate end, 'not merely PROOF, but _much more_, <ORG>.' 'For many forms are _equal in signification_ which are _differing in impression_, as the difference is great in the piercing of that which is _sharp_, and that which is _flat_, though the _strength_ of the percussion be the same; for instance, there is no man but will be a little more raised, by hearing it said, ""Your enemies will be glad of this,"" than by hearing it said only, ""This is evil for you.""' But it is thus that our <ORG> proceeds, whose comment on his Greek story we have interrupted. 'There is a voice to _flatter_, there is a voice to _instruct_, and a voice to _reprehend_. _I_ would not only have my voice to reach my hearer, but peradventure _that it strike_ and _<ORG>_ him. When I rate my footman in a sharp and bitter tone, it would be very fine for him to say, ""Pray master, speak lower, for I hear you very well."" _Speaking_ is _half his that speaks_, and _half his that hears_; the last ought to prepare himself to receive it, according to its motion, as with tennis players; he that receives the ball, shifts, draws back, and prepares himself to receive it, according as he sees him move, who strikes the stroke, and according to the stroke itself.' It is not, therefore, because this author has failed to furnish the rules of interpretation necessary for penetrating to the ultimate intention of this new kind of speaking, if all this affectation of simplicity, and all these absurd contradictory statements of his, have been suffered hitherto to pass unchallenged. It is the public mind he has to deal with. 'That which he adores in kings is the _throng_ of _their adorers_.' If he should take the public at once into his confidence, and tell them beforehand precisely what his own opinions were of things in general, if he should set before them in the outset the conclusions to which he proposed to drive them, he might indeed stand some chance to have his arguments interrupted, or changed with a magisterial authority; he would indeed find it necessary to pursue his philosophical points with a dagger in his hand.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.8437960147857666,0.8437960147857666,-3.2823374271392822

Thank you,” she whispered hurriedly. “Is the man over at the golf links?” asked the child, surprised to see that <PER> and her grandfather were going out together. “He will be by the time I get there,” returned the girl. As soon as the carriage door had closed and they had started, <PER> spoke. “You must think it very strange that I asked this of you, grandfather.” There was a hint of violets clinging to the fresh white garments that brushed Mr. <PER>'s knee. “I would not question the gifts the gods provide;” he returned. She seemed able to rise above the fear of his sarcasms. “Not that you would be surprised at anything mother or I might ask of you,” she continued bravely, “but I have suffered, I'm sure, as much as you have during <DATE>.” “Indeed?

It is because I want the real things, because I long for real things, for truth, that I asked to have this talk, grandfather, and I wanted to be quite alone with you, so I thought of this way.” “It's the mater she's running away from, then,” reflected her companion. He nodded courteously. “I am at your disposal,” he returned. Subtly the broker's feeling toward <PER> had been changing since <TIME> in which <ORG> wrote to her parents.

I am the law.” And he lifted his head so that the moon smote full upon his beautiful and ancient face. The face was the face of a Greek god grown old, but not grown either weak or ugly; there was nothing to break its regularity except a rather long chin with a cleft in it, and this rather added distinction than lessened beauty. His strong, well-opened eyes were very brilliant but quite colourless like steel. MacIan was one of those to whom a reverence and self-submission in ritual come quite easy, and are ordinary things. It was not artificial in him to bend slightly to this solemn apparition or to lower his voice when he said: “Do you bring me some message?” “I do bring you a message,” answered the man of moon and marble. “The king has returned.” <PER> did not ask for or require any explanation. “I suppose you can take me to the war,” he said, and the silent silver figure only bowed its head again. MacIan clambered into the silver boat, and it rose upward to the stars. To say that it rose to the stars is no mere metaphor, for the sky had cleared to that occasional and astonishing transparency in which one can see plainly both stars and moon. As the white-robed figure went upward in his white chariot, he said quite quietly to <PER>: “There is an answer to all the folly talked about equality. Some stars are big and some small; some stand still and some circle around them as they stand. They can be orderly, but they cannot be equal.” “They are all very beautiful,” said <PER>, as if in doubt. “They are all beautiful,” answered the other, “because each is in his place and owns his superior.

But in the Novum Organum, those more natural divisions are reduced to a form in which it IS _possible to commence practice_ with them at once, in certain departments, where there is no objection to _innovation_,--where the proposal for the relief of the human estate is met without opposition,--where the new scientific achievements in the conquest of nature are met with a universal, unanimous human plaudit and gratulation. '_In the meantime_,' he continues, after condemning those abstract terms, and declaring, that unless they terminate in _matter and construction, according_ to _true definitions_, they are _speculative_, and of _little use_--'_In the meantime, our classification will suffice_, and be of much use in the consideration of the PREDOMINANCE of POWERS, and examining the WRESTLING INSTANCES, which constitute our PRESENT SUBJECT.'

That is the philosophy which dismisses its technicalities, which finds such words as these when the question of the predominance of powers, and the question of revolution and abhorrence of change in the greater congregations and extensive wholes, comes to be practically handled. This is the way we philosophise 'when we come to particulars.' 'In _a rebellion_, When what's _not meet_, but what must be, was law, Then were they chosen.

1184,"But, unless when some fond mother enclosed a one-pound note to defray the private expenses of her son at college, it was frequently the case that the packets addressed to the doctor were the sole contents of the mail-bag.

And he has not been at all sparing of his hints on this subject over his own name, for those who have leisure to take them. 'The moral of this fable is,' he says, commenting in a certain place, on the wisdom of _the Ancients_, 'that men should not be confident of themselves, and imagine that a discovery of their excellences will always render them acceptable. _For this can only succeed_ according to _the nature_ and _manners_ of the person they _court or_ solicit, who, if he be a man not of the same gifts and endowments, but altogether of a haughty and insolent behaviour--(_here_ represented by _the person of Juno_)--_they must entirely drop the character_ that carries the least show of worth or gracefulness; if they proceed upon _any other_ footing it is _downright folly. Nor_ is it sufficient to _act_ the deformity of _obsequiousness_, unless they _really change themselves_, and _become_ abject and contemptible _in their persons_.' This was a time when abject and contemptible _persons_ could do what others could not do. Large enterprises, new developments of art and science, the most radical social innovations, were undertaken and managed, and very successfully, too, in that age, by persons of that description, though not without frequent glances on their part, at that little, apparently somewhat contradictory circumstance, in their history.

Surely there is no want of frankness here, so far as the men of judgment are concerned at least. And after condemning those innovators who have taken a different course, he says again, 'But to me on the other side that do desire as much as lieth in _my pen_, to ground a sociable intercourse between antiquity and _proficience_, it seemeth best to keep way with antiquity _usque ad <ORG>_; and therefore to _retain the ancient_ TERMS, though I sometimes alter the _uses and definitions_, according to the moderate proceeding in civil government, where, although there be some alteration, yet that <PER> which Tacitus _wisely_ <PER> 'eadem magistratuum vocabula.'

If it was, indeed, any object with him to avoid suspicion, and recent disclosures had then, perhaps, tended to sharpen somewhat the contemporary criticism; he _did well_, unquestionably, to omit that passage. But at the time when _that_ was written, he appears to be chiefly inclined to notice the remarkable facilities, which this style offers to an inventive genius.

1196,"Do as I do.” With a bound he was beside the little cluster of his clothes and boots that lay on the lawn; he snatched them up, without waiting to put any of them on; and tucking his sword under his other arm, went wildly at the wall at the bottom of the garden and swung himself over it. <TIME> after he had alighted in his socks on the other side, <ORG> alighted beside him, also in his socks and also carrying clothes and sword in a desperate bundle. They were in a by-street, very lean and lonely itself, but so close to a crowded thoroughfare that they could see the vague masses of vehicles going by, and could even see an individual hansom cab passing the corner at the instant. <PER> put his fingers to his mouth like a gutter-snipe and whistled twice. Even as he did so he could hear the loud voices of the neighbours and the police coming down the garden. The hansom swung sharply and came tearing down the little lane at his call. When the cabman saw his fares, however, <NUM> wild-haired men in their shirts and socks with naked swords under their arms, he not unnaturally brought his readiness to a rigid stop and stared suspiciously. “You talk to him <TIME>,” whispered <PER>, and stepped back into the shadow of the wall. “We want you,” said <ORG> to the cabman, with a superb Scotch drawl of indifference and assurance, “to drive us to <ORG>--verra quick.” “Very sorry, sir,” said the cabman, “but I'd like to know it was all right. Might I arst where you come from, sir?” A <NUM> after he spoke <PER> heard a heavy voice on the other side of the wall, saying: “I suppose I'd better get over and look for them. Give me a back.” “<ORG>,” said <ORG>, again assuming the most deliberate and lingering lowland Scotch intonation, “if ye're really verra anxious to <PER> a' come fra', I'll tell ye as a verra great secret. A' come from <LOC>. And a'm gaein' to <ORG>. Open the doors, cabby.” The cabman stared, but laughed. The heavy voice behind the wall said: “Now then, a better back this time, Mr. <PER>.” And from the shadow of the wall <PER> crept out. He had struggled wildly into his coat (leaving his waistcoat on the pavement), and he was with a fierce pale face climbing up the cab behind the cabman.",Chesterton,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9951590895652771,0.9951590895652771,-0.5061803460121155
1197,"Common propriety suggested that a point-blank intimation of that nature should be conveyed in a private interview; or, still better, by note. I immediately rose, tucked my jacket about me, bowed, and departed. And now, to do myself justice, I must add that, <DATE>, I was received with open arms by a glorious set of fellows—Mess No. 1!—numbering, among the rest, my noble Captain <PER>. This mess was principally composed of the headmost men of the gun-deck; and, out of a pardonable self-conceit, they called themselves the “_Forty-two-pounder Club;_” meaning that they were, one and all, fellows of large intellectual and corporeal calibre. Their mess-cloth was well located. On their starboard hand was Mess No. <NUM>, embracing sundry rare jokers and high livers, who waxed gay and epicurean over their salt fare, and were known as the “_Society for the Destruction of Beef and Pork_.” On the larboard hand was <LOC>, made up entirely of fore-top-men, a dashing, blaze-away set of men-of-war’s-men, who called themselves the “_Cape Horn Snorters and <PER>_.” Opposite, was one of the marine messes, mustering the aristocracy of the marine corps—the <NUM> corporals, the drummer and fifer, and <NUM> rather gentlemanly privates, native-born Americans, who had served in the <LOC> campaigns of <LOC>; and they now enlivened their salt fare with stories of wild ambushes in the <LOC>; and <NUM> of them related a surprising tale of his hand-to-hand encounter with <LOC>, the Indian chief, whom he fought <TIME> from daybreak till breakfast time. This slashing private also boasted that he could take a chip from between your teeth at <NUM> paces; he offered to bet any amount on it; and as he could get no one to hold the chip, his boast remained for ever good. Besides many other attractions which the _Forty-two-pounder Club_ furnished, it had this <NUM> special advantage, that, owing to there being so many _petty officers_ in it, all the members of the mess were exempt from doing duty as cooks and stewards. A fellow called _a steady-cook_, attended to that business during the entire cruise. He was a long, lank, pallid varlet, going by the name of <PER>. In very warm weather this <PER> would sit at the foot of the mess-cloth, fanning himself with the front flap of his frock or shirt, which he inelegantly wore over his trousers. <PER>, the President of the <ORG>, frequently remonstrated against this breach of good manners; but the _steady-cook_ had somehow contracted the habit, and it proved incurable.",HermanMelville,MarkTwain,0.5019542574882507,0.5019542574882507,-5.228940963745117
1201,"“I know I shall not forget yours,” said the other, and extended once more his ungainly arms in an unnatural gesture. Then of a sudden there came out of him a spout of wild and yet pompous phrases. “It is as well that you should know the worst and the best. I am a man who knows no limit; I am the most callous of criminals, the most unrepentant of sinners. There is no man in my dominions so vile as <PER> But my dominions stretch from the olives of <LOC> to the fir-woods of <LOC>, and there is no nook of all of them in which I have not done a sin. But when I bear you away I shall be doing my <NUM> sacrilege, and also my <NUM> act of virtue.” He seized her suddenly by the elbow; and she did not scream but only pulled and tugged. Yet though she had not screamed, someone astray in the woods seemed to have heard the struggle. A short but nimble figure came along the woodland path like a humming bullet and had caught <PER> a crack across the face before his own could be recognized. When it was recognized it was that of <PER>, with the black elderly beard and the young ardent eyes. Up to the moment when <PER> had hit the Count, <PER> had entertained no doubt that the <ORG> was merely a madman. Now she was startled with a new sanity; for the tall man in the yellow whiskers and yellow moustache <NUM> returned the blow of <PER>, as if it were a sort of duty, and then stepped back with a slight bow and an easy smile. “This need go no further here, <PER>,” he said. “I need not remind you how far it should go elsewhere.” “Certainly, you need remind me of nothing,” answered <PER>, stolidly. “I am glad that you are just not too much of a scoundrel for a gentleman to fight.” “We are detaining the lady,” said <PER>, with politeness; and, making a gesture suggesting that he would have taken off his hat if he had had one, he strode away up the avenue of trees and eventually disappeared.

1203,"That '_lumen siccum_' which his great contemporary is so fond of referring to in his philosophy, that _dry light_ which is so apt, he tells us, in most men's minds, to get 'drenched' a little sometimes, in 'the humours and affections,' and distorted and refracted in their mediums, did not always, perhaps, in its practical determinations, escape from that accident even in the philosopher's own; but in this stormy, world-hero, there was a latent volcano of will and passion; there was, in his constitution, 'a complexion' which might even seem to the bystanders to threaten at times, by its 'o'ergrowth,' the 'very pales and forts of reason'; but the intellect was, notwithstanding, in its due proportion in him; and it was the majestic intellect that triumphed in the end. It was the large and manly comprehension, 'the large discourse looking before and after,' it was the overseeing and active principle of 'the larger whole,' that predominated and had the steering of his course. It is the common human form which shines out in him and makes that manly demonstration, which commands our common respect, in spite of those particular defects and <DATE> which are apt to mar its outline in the best historical types and patterns of it, we have been able to get as yet. It was the intellect, and the sense which belongs to _that_ in its integrity--it was the truth and the feeling of its obligation, which was sovereign with him. For this is a man who appears to have been occupied with the care of the common-weal more than with anything else; and that, too, under great disadvantages and impediments, and when there was no honour in caring for it truly, but that kind of honour which he had so much of; for this was the time precisely which the poet speaks of in that play in which he tells us that the end of playing is 'to give to the very age and body of the time _its form and pressure_.' This was the time when 'virtue of vice _must pardon beg_, and curb and beck for leave to do it good.' It was the relief of man's estate, or the Creator's glory, that he busied himself about; that was the end of his ends; or if not, then was he, indeed, no hero at all.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.8848962187767029,0.8848962187767029,-2.7625224590301514
1204,"So soon as the _launch_ came alongside with them, orders were given to extinguish all lights and all fires in the ship; and the master-at-arms and his corporals inspected every deck to see that this order was obeyed; a very prudent precaution, no doubt, but not observed at all in the Turkish navy. The Turkish sailors will sit on their gun-carriages, tranquilly smoking, while kegs of powder are being rolled under their ignited pipe-bowls. This shows the great comfort there is in the doctrine of these <ORG>, and how such a doctrine, in some things at least, relieves men from nervous anxieties. But we all are <ORG> at bottom. Nor need we so much marvel at the heroism of that army officer, who challenged his personal foe to bestride a barrel of powder with him—the match to be placed between them—and be blown up in good company, for it is pretty certain that the whole earth itself is a vast hogshead, full of inflammable materials, and which we are always bestriding; at the same time, that all good Christians believe that at <TIME> <DATE> may come and the terrible combustion of the entire planet ensue. As if impressed with a befitting sense of the awfulness of his calling, our gunner always wore a fixed expression of solemnity, which was heightened by his grizzled hair and beard. But what imparted such a sinister look to him, and what wrought so upon my imagination concerning this man, was a frightful scar crossing his left cheek and forehead. He had been almost mortally wounded, they said, with a sabre-cut, during a frigate engagement in the last war with <LOC>. He was the most methodical, exact, and punctual of all the forward officers. Among his other duties, it pertained to him, while in harbour, to see that at <TIME> in the evening one of the great guns was discharged from the forecastle, a ceremony only observed in a flag-ship. And always at the precise moment you might behold him blowing his match, then applying it; and with that booming thunder in his ear, and the smell of the powder in his hair, he retired to his hammock for the night. What dreams he must have had! The same precision was observed when ordered to fire a gun to _bring to_ some ship at sea; for, true to their name, and preserving its applicability, even in times of peace, all men-of-war are great bullies on the high seas. They domineer over the poor merchantmen, and with a hissing hot ball sent bowling across the ocean, compel them to stop their headway at pleasure.",HermanMelville,EdgarAllanPoe,0.7366125583648682,0.7366125583648682,-3.9127883911132812
1205,"It needs but a point, a point which the Poet could not well put in,--one of those points which he speaks of elsewhere so significantly, to make the unmeaning line with which this great social Tragedy concludes, a sufficiently fitting conclusion to it; considering, at least, the pressure under which it was written; and the author has himself called our attention to that, as we see, even in this little jingle of rhymes, put in apparently, only for professional purposes, and merely to get the curtain down decently. It is a point, which it takes the key of the play--Lord Bacon's key, of '<ORG>,' to put in. It wants but a comma, but then it must be a comma in the right place, to make English of it. Plain English, unvarnished English, but poetic in its fact, as any prophecy that <PER> was to make. 'The oldest hath borne most, we that are _young_ Shall never see so much, nor live so long.'

The question of the authorship of the great philosophic poems which are the legacy of the Elizabethan Age to us, is an incidental question in this inquiry, and is incidentally treated here.

The young man regarded her with increasing interest and curiosity. “Don't you wonder how I knew that your fare was paid?” he asked. “How did you?” “I met Mr. <PER> hurrying through the station. He said his granddaughter was on this train and asked me to look out for a little girl with a doll.” “Oh,” returned the child, pleased, “then you know grandpa.” “I've known him ever since I was no bigger than you are. But even then,” added the doctor mentally, “I hadn't supposed him capable of sending this baby out from the city alone.” <PER> watched the kind eyes attentively. “So you see,” he went on, “all I had to do was to look for <PER>.” “And you nearly sat on her,” declared the child. “I deny it,” returned the doctor gravely. “I deny it. You weren't looking. For <TIME> I was afraid you were crying.” “Crying! What would I be crying for, coming to have a lovely visit at grandpa's!” “I suppose you are in a hurry to see your aunt and cousin?” remarked the doctor. “Yes, but I don't know them. You see,” explanatorily, “they aren't my real relations.” “Indeed?” “No, aunt <ORG> is my uncle's wife and cousin <PER> is her little girl, but not uncle <PER>'s.” The doctor thought a minute. “Really? She is a very charming little girl, is your cousin <PER>. Aren't you going to tell me your name?” “My name is <PER>.” “And I am Dr. <PER>, so now we are properly introduced.” He smiled upon her with merry eyes, and she responded politely:-- “I'm very glad you found us.” Arrived at <ORG>, the doctor picked up his case and <PER> followed him from the train. He looked about expectantly for Mrs. <PER> or her daughter. They were not there. The little girl's quick eyes discerned a light-haired driver and a brown horse coming around a curve of the pretty landscape gardening which beautified the station. At the same moment Dr. <PER> recognized the equipage with relief. “They've sent for you. That is all right,” he said, and '<PER>, with one side glance at the little stranger, drew up by the platform. “Good-morning, <PER>.",unknown,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9864392280578613,0.9864392280578613,-1.5389447212219238
1218,"'Away with that eloquence that so enchants us with its _harmony_, that we should more study it than _things_' [what new soul of philosophy is this, then, already?] --'unless you will affirm that of _<ORG>_ to be of so supreme perfection as to form _a body_ of itself. And of him, I shall further add <NUM> story we read of to this purpose, wherein _his nature_ will _much more manifestly be laid open to us_' [than in that seeming care for his fame in <DATE>, or in that lower object of style, just dismissed so scornfully].

The word 'time'--here admits of a double rendering whereby the _author's_ aims are more manifestly laid open; and there is also another word in this sentence which carries a 'delicate sound' with it, to those who have met this author in other fields, and who happen to be of his counsel. But lest the stories of themselves should still seem flat and pointless, or trivial and insignificant to the uninstructed ear, it may be necessary to interweave them with some further 'allegations on this subject,' which the author assumes, or appears to assume, in his own person.

1220,"Let no one say that this reformer is one of those who expose our miserable condition, without offering to improve it; or that he is one of those who take away our gold and jewels with their tests, and leave us no equivalent. This is no destroyer. He will help us to save all that we have. He is guarding us from the error of those who would let it alone till the masses have taken the work in hand for themselves, without science. '_That_ is the way to lay all flat.' He is not one of those, 'who to _make clean, efface_, and who cure diseases by death.' To found so great a thing as the state anew; to dissolve that so old and solid structure, and undertake to recompose it as a whole on the spot, is a piece of work which this chemist, after a survey of his apparatus, declines to take in; though he fairly admits, that if the question were of 'a new world,' and not 'a world already formed to certain customs,' science might have, perhaps, some important suggestions to make as to the original structure. And yet for all that, it is a scientific practice that is propounded here. It is a scientific innovation and renovation, that is propounded; the greatest that was ever propounded,--total, absolute, but not sudden. It is a remedy for the world as it is, that this reformer is propounding. New constructions according to true definitions, scientific institutions,--institutions of culture and regimen and cure, based on the recognition of the actual human constitution and laws,--based on an observation as diligent and subtle, and precepts as severe as those which we apply to the culture of any other form in nature,--that is the proposition. 'It were a strange _speech_ which, spoken or spoken oft, should reclaim a man from a vice to which he is by nature subject.' '<PER> is not to be cured by bare admonition.' This plan of culture and cure involves not the knowledge of that nature which is in all men only, but a science, enriched with most careful collections of all the specific varieties of that nature. The fullest natural history of those forces that are operant in the <TIME> life of man, the most profound and subtle observation of the facts of this history, the most thoroughly scientific collection of them, make the beginning of this enterprise.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9885780811309814,0.9885780811309814,-2.1463444232940674

Thus they approached the piazza and came close before noting that it was occupied. “<PER>, see me!” cried <PER> delightedly. <PER> met the unsmiling gaze of his host as Mr. <PER> rose, and then caught sight of Mrs. <PER> stonily gazing from her chair. “Ah, how do you do?” he called laughingly. “<PER>, he is a good looking chap!” thought the host, and <PER> set <PER> down at his feet with such velocity that <PER> was cast heavily to earth. “<NUM> pardons!” exclaimed <PER>, catching up the doll by the skirt and restoring her. <PER> gave him a bright look. “_She_ knows there is no sensation in matter,” she said scornfully.

1234,"But then it is a Duke on whom this indignity is practised; for it is to be remarked, in passing, that though this Poet is evidently bent on making his exhibition a thorough one, though he is determined not to leave out anything of importance in his diagrams, he does not appear inclined to soil his fingers by meddling with the lower orders, or to countenance any innovation in his art in that respect. Whenever he has occasion to introduce persons of this class into his pieces, they come in and go out, and perform their part in his scene, very much as they do elsewhere in his time. Even when his Players come in, they do not speak many words on their own behalf. They stand civilly, and answer questions, and take their orders, and fulfil them. That is all that is looked for at their hands. For this is not a Poet who has ever given any <NUM> occasion in his own time, to distinguish him as the Poet of the People. It is always from the highest social point of observation that he takes those views of the lower ranks, which he has occasion to introduce into his Plays, from the mobs of 'greasy citizens' to the details of the sheep-shearing feast; and even in <LOC> he keeps it still. There never was a more aristocratic poet apparently, and though the very basest form of outcast misery 'that ever penury in contempt of man brought near to beast,' though the basest and most ignoble and pitiful human liabilities, are every where included in his plan; he will have nothing but the rich blood of dukes and kings to take him through with it--he will have nothing lower and less illustrious than these to play his parts for him. It is a king to whom 'the _Farm House_,' where _both_ fire and food are waiting, becomes a royal luxury on his return from the _Hovel's_ door, brought in chattering out of the tempest, in that pitiful stage of human want, which had made him ready to share with <PER>, nay, with the _swine_, their rude comforts. 'Art cold? I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow. Your _hovel_:--come bring us to your _hovel_.' It is a king who gets an ague in the storm, who finds the tyranny of the night too rough for nature to endure; it is a king on whose desolate outcast head, destitution and social wrongs accumulate their results, till his wits begin to turn, till his mind is shattered, and he comes on to the stage at last, a poor bedlamite.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9961328506469727,0.9961328506469727,-2.1150972843170166

1238,"At last she went downstairs to a side door to watch for <PER> as he drove from the barn on his way to the station to meet Mr. <PER>. As the horse walked out of the barn she emerged and intercepted the coachman. Mrs. <PER> at a window saw <PER> stop. She wondered what <PER> was saying to him, wondered with a humble gratitude novel to her dominating nature. “Wait <TIME>, <PER>,” said the child. “I've been wondering whether I ought to say anything to grandpa.” “If you do I'll lose my place,” returned the young fellow; “and I've never done wrong by the horses yet.” “I know you haven't. God has taken care of you, hasn't he, <PER>? Do you think it's right for me not to tell grandpa? I've decided that I'll do whatever you say.” It was the wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the dove. <PER>, nervously fingering the whip handle, looked down into the guileless face and mentally vowed never to betray the trust he saw there. “Then don't tell him, <PER>,” he returned rather thickly, for the fullness in his throat. “You come out to the barn the way you said you would, and we'll talk over things. I don't care if the boys do laugh. I've sworn off. I believe you helped <PER> <TIME>. I believe you can help me.” <PER>'s eyes were joyful. “If you know you _want_ help, <PER>, then you'll get it.

When she saw it coming she ran down to the gate and hopped and skipped back beside it, Mr. <PER> watching her gyrations unsmilingly. As he dismounted at the piazza she clung to his hand going up the steps. “Which are you going to do, grandpa, go riding or play golf?” “Which do you want me to do?” he asked. “When you ride it's more fun for me,” she replied. He seated himself in one of the chairs and she leaned against its broad arm. “It's rather more fun for me, too.

1239,"Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully; but when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed and we ne'er the wiser. _King_. If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after. _Will_. _Mass, you'll pay him then!_ That's a perilous shot out of an _elder gun_, that a poor and _private_ displeasure can do against a monarch. _You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice_, with fanning in his face with a peacock's feather. And, indeed, thus and not any less absurd and monstrous, appeared the idea of subjecting the king to any effect from the subject's displeasure, or the idea of calling him to account--this one, helpless, frail, private man, as he has just been conceded by the king himself to be, for any amount of fraud or dishonesty to the nation, for any breach of trust or honour. For his relation to the _mass_ and the source of this fearful irresponsible power was not understood then. The soldier states it well. One might, indeed, as well go about to turn the sun to ice, _with fanning in his face_ with a peacock's feather. 'You'll never trust his word after,' the soldier continues. 'Come, 'tis a foolish saying.' 'Your reproof is something _too round_,' is the king's reply. It is indeed round. It is one of those round replies that this poet is so fond of, and the king himself becomes 'the private' of it, when once the centre of this play is found, and the sweep of its circumference is taken. For the sovereignty of law, the kingship of the universal law _in whomsoever it speaks_, awful with God's power, armed with _his_ pains and penalties is the scientific sovereignty; and in the scientific diagrams the passions, 'the poor and private passions,' and the arbitrary will, in whomsoever they speak, no matter what symbols of sovereignty they have contrived to usurp, make no better figure in their struggles with that law, than that same which the poet's vivid imagination and intense perception of incompatibilities, has seized on here.

The blades crossed again with the same sound like song, and the men went to work again with the same white and watchful faces. <PER>, in his impatience, went back a little to his wildness.

1268,"He cannot even recognize the common kindred in that guise, as the king does, when he philosophises on his condition. And the rough aristocratic contempt and indifference which is manifested by <ORG>, as a matter of course, for this poor human victim of wrong and misfortune, is made to contrast with their boundless sympathy and tenderness for the _king_, while the poet aiming at broader relationships, finds the mantle of _his_ humanity wide enough for them, _both_. As for the king,--startled in the midst of those new views of human wretchedness which his own sufferings have occasioned, and while those desires to _remedy it_, with which his penitence is accompanied, are still on his lip, by this wild apparition and embodiment of his thought, in that new accession of his mental disorder, which the presence of this object seems to occasion, that confounding of proximate conceptions, which leads him to regard this man as a source of new light on human affairs, is one of those exquisite physiological exhibitions of which only this scientific artist is capable. And, in fact, it must be confessed, that this 'learned <PER>' himself, notwithstanding the unexpected dignity of his promotion, does not appear to be altogether wanting in a taste, at least, for that new kind of philosophical investigation, which seems to be looked for at his hands. The king's inquiries appear to fall in remarkably with the previous train of his pursuits. In the course of his experiments, he seems himself to have struck upon that new philosophic proceeding, which has been called 'putting philosophy upon the right road again.' Only the philosophic domain which that new road in philosophy leads to, appears to be very considerably broader, as '<PER>' takes it, than that very vivid, but narrow limitation of its fields, which Mr. <PER> has set down in our time, would make it. Indeed, this 'philosopher,' that _<ORG>_ so much inclines to, appears to have included in his investigations the <NUM> _extremes_ of the new science of practice. He has sounded it apparently 'from its lowest note to the top of its key.' 'What is your study?' says the king to him, eyeing him curiously, and apparently struck with the practical result--anxious to have a word with him in private, but obliged to conduct the examination on the stage. 'How to prevent THE FIEND,' is <PER>'s reply. 'How to prevent the fiend _and_ to kill vermin.'

What those flat wooden cases were they could form no conception.

It is by means of this popular rejection of the <ORG>'s claims, which the tribunes succeed in procuring, that the Poet is enabled to complete his exhibition and test of the virtue which he finds in his time 'chiefest among men, and that which most dignifies the haver'; the virtue which he finds in his time rewarded with patents of nobility, with patrician trust, with priestly authority, with immortal fame, and thrones and dominions, with the disposal of the human welfare, and the entail of it to the crack of doom--no matter what 'goslings' the law of entail may devolve it on. He makes use of this incident to complete that separation he is effecting in the hitherto unanalysed, ill-defined, popular notions, and received and unquestioned axioms of practice--that separation of the instinctive military heroism, and the principle of the so-called heroic greatness, from the true principles of heroism and nobility, the true principle of subjection and sovereignty in the individual human nature and in the common-weal. That _martial_ virtue has been under criticism and suspicion torn the beginning of this action. It was shown from the <NUM>--from that ground and point of observation which the sufferings of the diseased common-weal made for it--in no favourable light. It was branded in the <NUM> scene, in the person of its Hero, as 'a dog to the commonalty.' It is one of the wretched 'commons' who invents, in his distress, that title for it; but the Poet himself exhibits it, not descriptively only, but dramatically, as something more brutish than that--eating the poor man's corn that the gods have sent him, and gnawing his vitals, devouring him soul and body, 'tooth and fell.' It was shown up from the <NUM> as an instinct that men share with 'rats'. It was brought out from the <NUM>, and exhibited with its teeth in the heart of the common-weal.

1275,"There was a <ORG> blind in the upper part of the door, which he threw up when inside so as to admit a little air. And there you would see him, with a green shade over his eyes, seated on a stool, and pounding his pestle in a great iron mortar that looked like a howitzer, mixing some jallapy compound. A smoky lamp shed a flickering, yellow-fever tinge upon his pallid face and the closely-packed regiments of gallipots. Several times when I felt in need of a little medicine, but was not ill enough to report myself to the surgeon at his levees, I would call of a morning upon his steward at the Sign of the Mortar, and beg him to give me what I wanted; when, without speaking a word, this cadaverous young man would mix me my potion in a tin cup, and hand it out through the little opening in his door, like the boxed-up treasurer giving you your change at the ticket-office of a theatre. But there was a little shelf against the wall of the door, and upon this I would set the tin cup for a while, and survey it; for I never was a <PER> at taking medicine; and to take it in this way, without a single attempt at disguising it; with no counteracting little morsel to hurry down after it; in short to go to the very apothecary’s in person, and there, at the counter, swallow down your dose, as if it were a nice mint-julep taken at the bar of a hotel—_this_ was a bitter bolus indeed. But, then, this pallid young apothecary charged nothing for it, and _that_ was no small satisfaction; for is it not remarkable, to say the least, that a shore apothecary should actually charge you money—round dollars and cents—for giving you a horrible nausea? My tin cup would wait a long time on that little shelf; yet “Pills,” as the sailors called him, never heeded my lingering, but in sober, silent sadness continued pounding his mortar or folding up his powders; until at last some other customer would appear, and then in a sudden frenzy of resolution, I would gulp down my sherry-cobbler, and carry its unspeakable flavour with me far up into the frigate’s main-top.

1279,"But to toil and sweat in a fictitious encounter; to squander the precious breath of my precious body in a ridiculous fight of shams and pretensions; to hurry about the decks, pretending to carry the killed and wounded below; to be told that I must consider the ship blowing up, in order to exercise myself in presence of mind, and prepare for a real explosion; all this I despise, as beneath a true tar and man of valour. These were my sentiments at the time, and these remain my sentiments still; but as, while on board the frigate, my liberty of thought did not extend to liberty of expression, I was obliged to keep these sentiments to myself; though, indeed, I had some thoughts of addressing a letter, marked _Private and Confidential_, to his Honour the <ORG>, on the subject. My station at the batteries was at <NUM> of the <NUM> carronades, on the starboard side of the quarter-deck. For the benefit of a <ORG> reader here and there, a word or <NUM> in explanation of a carronade may not be amiss. The carronade is a gun comparatively short and light for its calibre. A carronade throwing a thirty-two-pound shot weighs considerably less than a long-gun only throwing a twenty-four-pound shot. It further differs from a long-gun, in working with a joint and bolt underneath, instead of the short arms or _trunnions_ at the sides. Its _carriage_, likewise, is quite different from that of a long-gun, having a sort of sliding apparatus, something like an extension dining-table; the goose on it, however, is a tough one, and villainously stuffed with most indigestible dumplings. Point-blank, the range of a carronade does not exceed <NUM>, much less than the range of a long-gun. When of large calibre, however, it throws within that limit, <LOC> shot, all manner of shells and combustibles, with great effect, being a very destructive engine at close quarters. This piece is now very generally found mounted in the batteries of the English and American navies. The quarter-deck armaments of most modern frigates wholly consist of carronades. The name is derived from the village of <LOC>, in <LOC>, at whose celebrated founderies this iron <PER> was <NUM> cast. I did not fancy this station at all; for it is well known on shipboard that, in time of action, the quarter-deck is one of the most dangerous posts of a man-of-war. The reason is, that the officers of the highest rank are there stationed; and the enemy have an ungentlemanly way of target-shooting at their buttons.",HermanMelville,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9868984222412109,0.9868984222412109,-0.3086676299571991

1282,"The features of that living impersonation of the heroic faults and virtues which 'the mirror,' that professed to give to 'the very body of the time, its form and pressure,' could not fail to show, are glimmering here constantly in 'this ancient piece,' and often shine out in the more critical passages, with such unmistakeable clearness, as to furnish an effectual diversion for any eye, that should undertake to fathom prematurely the player's intention. For 'the gentleman who wrote the late Shepherd's Calendar' was not the only poet of this time, as it would seem, who found the scope of a double intention, in his poetic representation, not adequate to the comprehension of his design--who laid on another and another still, and found the complexity convenient. 'The sense is the best judge,' this Poet says, in his doctrine of criticism, declining peremptorily to accept of the ancient rules in matters of taste;--a rule in art which requires, of course, a corresponding rule of interpretation. In fact, it is no bad exercise for an ordinary mind, to undertake to track the contriver of these plays, through all the latitudes which his art, as he understands it, gives him.

Oh mother!” Mrs. <PER> pushed the pleading hand away. “I can't tell how long it will be!” she returned impatiently. “We are simply helpless until your father's affairs are settled. I thought I had told you that, <PER>. He worshipped you, child, and no matter what that old curmudgeon says, <PER> would wish us to remain under his protection until we see our way clear.” “Won't you have a business talk with him, so we can know what we have to look forward to?” The girl's voice was unsteady. “I will when the right time comes, <PER>. Can't you trust your mother? Isn't it enough that we have lost our home, our carriages, all our comforts and luxuries, through this man's bad judgment--” “You will cling to that!” despairingly. “And have had to come out to this Sleepy Hollow of a place, where life means mere existence, and be so poor that the carfare into <LOC> is actually a consideration!",unknown,VirginiaWoolf,0.9370245337486267,0.9370245337486267,-2.4591479301452637
1299,"If God will help you, be it so; but by those words you have turned my heart to stone."" At this period of their conversation, when <PER>'s peril seemed most imminent, the attention of both was attracted by a fragment of rock, which, falling from the summit of the crag, struck very near them. <PER> started from her knees, and, with her false guide, gazed eagerly upward,--he in the fear of interruption, she in the hope of deliverance. CHAPTER IX. ""At length, he cries, behold the fated spring! <PER> rugged cliff conceals the fountain blest, <ORG> rocks its crystal source o'ershadowing."" PSYCHE. The tale now returns to <PER>, who, as will be recollected, after being overtaken by <PER>, was left with little apparent prospect of aiding in the deliverance of <PER>. It would be difficult to analyze the feelings with which the student pursued the chase, or to decide whether he was influenced and animated by the same hopes of successful love that cheered his rival. That he was conscious of such hopes, there is little reason to suppose; for the most powerful minds are not always the best acquainted with their own feelings. Had <PER>, moreover, acknowledged to himself the possibility of gaining <PER>'s affections, his generosity would have induced him to refrain from her society before it was too late. He had read her character with accuracy, and had seen how fit she was to love, and to be loved, by a man who could find his happiness in the common occupations of the world; and <PER> never deceived himself so far as to suppose that this would be the case with him. Indeed, he often wondered at the passion with which <PER>'s simple loveliness of mind and person had inspired him, and which seemed to be founded on the principle of contrariety, rather than of sympathy. It was the yearning of a soul, formed by Nature in a peculiar mould, for communion with those to whom it bore a resemblance, yet of whom it was not. But there was no reason to suppose that <PER>, who differed from the multitude only as being purer and better, would cast away her affections on the one, of all who surrounded her, least fitted to make her happy. Thus <PER> reasoned with himself, and of this he believed that he was convinced. Yet ever and anon he found himself involved in a dream of bliss, of which <PER> was to be the giver and the sharer. Then would he rouse himself, and press upon his mind the chilling consciousness that it was and could be but a dream.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9289000034332275,0.9289000034332275,-4.577538013458252

Mrs. <PER> looked often toward the door, expectant of the doctor's entrance. <TIME> wore on and he did not come. Still <PER>'s face wore the placid, restful expression. A gentle ease with her grandfather replaced her old manner. Her mother determined to try an experiment. “You could never guess who called to-day, <PER>,” she said suddenly. Her daughter looked up from her coffee. “No. Who was it?” “<PER>.” “Really!” The girl's tone indicated great surprise, and that only. “I wish I might have seen him.” The addition was made so calmly, almost perfunctorily, that Mrs. <PER> smiled with exultation. She turned to her father-in-law. “Who would believe that Mr. <PER> was <PER>'s brightest flame <DATE>? 'How soon are we forgot! '” she said lightly. When <PER> had kissed them all good-night and gone upstairs, and Mr. <PER> had withdrawn to his library, Mrs. <PER> took her child's hand and looked fondly into her eyes. “Well?” she asked. “Well,” returned <PER>, “do tell me everything <PER> said.” “After you've told me everything Dr. <PER> said. I supposed you'd fly to tell me, dear.” The girl looked tenderly back into the eyes that were sharp with inquiry. “Dear little mother,” she returned, “it can't be.” “What can't be?” “What you wish. Dr. <PER>.” “Have you--refused him--!” Mrs. <PER>'s face whitened, and unconsciously she stepped back. “It didn't have to come to that. Dr. <PER> is so fine--such a wise man in so many ways. I do admire him so much.” “What did you say to him? I will know!” exclaimed Mrs. <PER> passionately. <PER> was mute, and her eyes besought her mother. “Speak, I say! Was it Christian Science? Did you dare, <PER>, did you _dare_ spoil your life--my life--our future, by scaring Dr. <PER> with that bugbear?” The angry woman was breathing fast. “Mother dear, don't give us something so painful to remember. Don't, I beg of you. Dr. <PER> does not reproach me.

Is it not so, Surgeon Patella?” turning toward that gentleman, as if relying upon some sort of an assent, however clogged with conditions. “Certainly,” said Patella, “amputation is your only resource, Mr. <PER> of the Fleet; that is, I mean, if you are fully persuaded of its necessity.” The other surgeons said nothing, maintaining a somewhat reserved air, as if conscious that they had no positive authority in the case, whatever might be their own private opinions; but they seemed willing to behold, and, if called upon, to assist at the operation, since it could not now be averted. The young men, their Assistants, looked very eager, and cast frequent glances of awe upon so distinguished a practitioner as the venerable <ORG>. “They say he can drop a leg in <TIME> and <TIME> from the moment the knife touches it,” whispered <NUM> of them to another. “We shall see,” was the reply, and the speaker clapped his hand to his fob, to see if his watch would be forthcoming when wanted. “Are you all ready here?” demanded <ORG>, now advancing to his steward; “have not those fellows got through yet?” pointing to <NUM> men of the carpenter’s gang, who were placing bits of wood under the gun-carriages supporting the central table. “They are just through, sir,” respectfully answered the steward, touching his hand to his forehead, as if there were a cap-front there. “Bring up the patient, then,” said <ORG>. “Young gentlemen,” he added, turning to the row of <ORG>, “seeing you here reminds me of the classes of students once under my instruction at <ORG>.

1308,"The sound of a soft, sweet voice, the glance of a gentle eye, had wrought a change upon him; and in his ardent mind <TIME> had done the work of many. Almost in spite of himself, the new sensation was inexpressibly delightful.

1309,"At last I saw a chance, and crowded in for the hole; and in order to be beforehand with a big man who just then came in, I pushed my gun violently through the hole; upon which the hook-nosed man cried out, thinking I was going to shoot him.

1324,"Shall we be content any longer with a knowledge that is _power_,--shall we boast ourselves any longer of a scientific _art_ that leaves _human_ nature,--that makes over human nature to the tampering of an unwatched, unchecked empiricism, that leaves our own souls it may be, and the souls in which ours are garnered up, all wild and hidden, and gnarled within with nature's crudities and spontaneities, or choked and bitter with artificial, but unscientific, unartistic repression?

1326,"How were these officers to gain glory? How but by a distinguished slaughtering of their fellow-men. How were they to be promoted? How but over the buried heads of killed comrades and mess-mates. This hostile contrast between the feelings with which the common seamen and the officers of the <PER> looked forward to this more than possible war, is one of many instances that might be quoted to show the antagonism of their interests, the incurable antagonism in which they dwell. But can men, whose interests are diverse, ever hope to live together in a harmony uncoerced? Can the brotherhood of the race of mankind ever hope to prevail in a man-of-war, where <NUM> man’s bane is almost another’s blessing? By abolishing the scourge, shall we do away tyranny; _that_ tyranny which must ever prevail, where of <NUM> essentially antagonistic classes in perpetual contact, one is immeasurably the stronger? Surely it seems all but impossible. And as the very object of a man-of-war, as its name implies, is to fight the very battles so naturally averse to the seamen; so long as a man-of-war exists, it must ever remain a picture of much that is tyrannical and repelling in human nature. Being an establishment much more extensive than <ORG>, the English armed marine furnishes a yet more striking example of this thing, especially as the existence of war produces so vast an augmentation of her naval force compared with what it is in time of peace. It is well known what joy the news of <PER>’s sudden return from <PER> created among crowds of British naval officers, who had previously been expecting to be sent ashore on <NUM>-pay. Thus, when all the world wailed, these officers found occasion for <DATE>. I urge it not against them as men—their feelings belonged to their profession. Had they not been naval officers, they had not been rejoicers in the midst of despair. When shall the time come, how much longer will God postpone it, when the clouds, which at times gather over the horizons of nations, shall not be hailed by any class of humanity, and invoked to burst as a bomb? Standing navies, as well as standing armies, serve to keep alive the spirit of war even in the meek heart of peace.

1329,"Perceiving a pure and bright little fountain at a short distance from the cottage, they approached it, and, using the bark of a birch-tree as a cup, partook of its cool waters. They then pursued their homeward ride with such diligence, that, just as the sun was setting, they came in sight of the humble wooden edifice which was dignified with the name of <ORG>. A golden ray rested upon the spire of the little chapel, the bell of which sent its tinkling murmur down the valley to summon the wanderers to evening prayers. <PER> returned to his chamber that night, and lighted his lamp as he had been wont to do.

He asked himself to what purpose was all this destructive labor, and where was the happiness of superior knowledge. He had climbed but a few steps of a ladder that reached to infinity: he had thrown away his life in discovering, that, after <NUM> such lives, he should still know comparatively nothing. He even looked forward with dread--though once the thought had been dear to him--to the eternity of improvement that lay before him.

1331,"It was his wish to pursue the chase on his own responsibility, and as his own wisdom dictated: he chose to be an independent ally, rather than a subordinate assistant. But, as a step preliminary to his proceedings of every other kind, he found it absolutely necessary, having journeyed far, and fasting, to call upon the landlord for a supply of food. The viands that were set before him were homely but abundant; nor were <PER>'s griefs and perplexities so absorbing as to overcome the appetite of youth and health. Dr. <PER> and Mr. <PER>, after a short private conversation, had summoned the landlord, in the hope of obtaining some clew to the development of the mystery. But no young lady, nor any stranger answering to the description the doctor had received from <PER> (which was indeed a false one), had been seen to pass through the village since daybreak. Here, therefore, the friends were entirely at a loss in what direction to continue the pursuit. The village was the focus of several roads, diverging to widely distant portions of the country; and which of these the fugitives had taken, it was impossible to determine. <NUM> point, however, might be considered certain,--that the village was the <NUM> stage of their flight; for it commanded the only outlet from the valley, except a rugged path among the hills, utterly impassable by horse. In this dilemma, expresses were sent by each of the different roads; and poor <PER>'s imprudence--the tale nowise decreasing as it rolled along--became known to a wide extent of country. Having thus done everything in his power to recover his daughter, the merchant exhibited a composure which Dr. <PER> admired, but could not equal.

1332,"My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established <TIME> and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible. Chapter 22 The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to <LOC>. I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me! My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride. “Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride. <PER>, poor unhappy <PER>, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her. <PER>, <PER>, and <PER>—they all died by my hands.” My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence.

1333,"And then I bent over her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!’ “The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of <PER> and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in <NUM> of the folds of her dress.

He continued, “You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.” The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me. “I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me.

1337,"She went on repeating them aloud, and starting at the sound of her own voice, till at length, as <NUM> name passed through her lips, she paused, and then, leaning her forehead against the letters, burst into tears. It was the name of <PER>; and it struck upon her heart, arousing her to a full sense of her present misfortunes and dangers, and, more painful still, of her past happiness. Her tears had, however, a soothing, and at the same time a strengthening effect upon her mind; for, when their gush was over, she raised her head, and began to meditate on the means of escape. She wondered at the species of fascination that had kept her, as if chained to the rock, so long, when there was, in reality, nothing to bar her pathway. She determined, late as it was, to attempt her own deliverance, and for that purpose began slowly and cautiously to emerge from the cave. Peeping out from among the trees, she looked and listened with most painful anxiety to discover if any living thing were in that seeming solitude, or if any sound disturbed the heavy stillness. But she saw only Nature in her wildest forms, and heard only the plash and murmur (almost inaudible, because continual) of the little waterfall, and the quick, short throbbing of her own heart, against which she pressed her hand as if to hush it. Gathering courage, therefore, she began to descend; and, starting often at the loose stones that even her light footstep displaced and sent rattling down, she at length reached the base of the crag in safety. She then made a few steps in the direction, as nearly as she could judge, by which she arrived at the spot, but paused, with a sudden revulsion of the blood to her heart, as her guide emerged from behind a projecting part of the rock. He approached her deliberately, an ironical smile writhing his features into a most disagreeable expression; while in his eyes there was something that seemed a wild, fierce joy. By a species of sophistry, of which oppressors often make use, he had brought himself to believe that he was now the injured one, and that <PER>, by her distrust of him, had fairly subjected herself to whatever evil it consisted with his will and power to inflict upon her.

Mrs. <PER> unlocked the trunk, lifted out the tray, and began in a business-like manner to dispose of the small belongings that had last been handled so tenderly. “Mrs. <PER> certainly knows how to pack,” ran her thoughts, “and she'd naturally know how to sew.

It only matters that they shall be obedient and good.” <PER> regarded her with the patience which children exercise toward the inevitable. “I'd like to fix <PER> drawer myself,” she said modestly. “Very well, you may.

1342,"But here is the _common_ nature in this kind, which must make the basis of any permanent universal social constitution for it. Different races will require that their own constitutional differences shall be respected in their social constitutions; and if they be not, for the worse or for the better, look for change. But this is the universal platform that science is clearing here. This is the WORLD that she is concerning herself with here, in the person of that High Priest of hers, who, also, took that to be his business. Here are these powers in man, then, to begin with. Here is this universal natural predisposition in him, not to subsist, merely, and maintain his form--which is nature's <NUM> law, they tell us--but to 'better himself' in some way. As <PER> expresses it, 'he lacks advancement'; and advancement he will have, or strive to have, if not '_formal_ and _essential_,' then 'local.' He is instinctively impelled to it; and in his ignorant attempt to compass that end which nature has prescribed to him, the 'tempest of human life' arises. The scientific plan will be, not to quarrel with these universal forces, and undertake to found society on their annihilation. Science will count that structure unsafe which is founded on the supposed annihilation of these forces in anything that moves. The man of science knows, that though by the predominance of powers, or by the equilibrium of them, they may be for a time, '_as it were_, annihilated,' they are in every creature; and nature in the instincts, though blind, is cunning, and finds ways and means of overcoming barriers, and evading restrictions, and inclines to indemnify herself when once she finds her way again. Instead of quarrelling with these forces, the scientific plan, having respect to <ORG> in the constitution of man, overlooking them from that height, will thankfully accept them, and make much of them. These are just the motive powers that science has need of; she could not compose her structure without them, which is only the perfecting of the structure which the great Creating Wisdom had already outlined and pre-ordered--not a machine, but a living organic whole. Science takes this 'piece of work' as she finds him, ready, waiting for the hand of art--imperfect, unfinished, but with the proceeding of nature incorporated in him--with the creative, advancing, perfecting motion, incorporated in him as his essence and law;--imperfect, but with nature working within him for the rest, urging him to self-perfection.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9960581064224243,0.9960581064224243,-1.5425117015838623

Even in these abbreviated, translated, and <NUM>-hand records we receive an impression such as no other life can give--an impression which fills us with utter reverence. <PER>, no mean judge of human nature, said of it: ""It is different with Christ. Everything about Him astonishes me. His spirit surprises me, and His will confounds me. Between Him and anything of this world there is no possible comparison. He is really a being apart. The nearer I approach Him and the closer I examine Him, the more everything seems above me."" It is this wonderful life, its example and inspiration, which was the real object of the descent of this high spirit on to our planet. If the human race had earnestly centred upon that instead of losing itself in vain dreams of vicarious sacrifices and imaginary falls, with all the mystical and contentious philosophy which has centred round the subject, how very different the level of human culture and happiness would be to-day! Such theories, with their absolute want of reason or morality, have been the main cause why the best minds have been so often alienated from the Christian system and proclaimed themselves materialists. In contemplating what shocked their instincts for truth they have lost that which was both true and beautiful. Christ's death was worthy of His life, and rounded off a perfect career, but it is the life which He has left as the foundation for the permanent religion of mankind.",ArthurConanDoyle,OscarWilde,0.9927565455436707,0.9927565455436707,-0.5213091373443604

Turning towards the men, he said, “What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then, so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome.

Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.” He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return.

These are the _Elizabethan_ men that we have to interpret here, because, though they rest from their labours, their works do follow them--the Elizabethan _Men_ of _Letters_; and we must know what that title means before we can read them or their works, before we can '_untie_ their _spell_.'

1379,"Well, my sweet and pleasant friend, I will have them weighed out to you when the auction is over.” In like manner all the contents of the bags were disposed of, embracing old frocks, trowsers, and jackets, the various sums for which they went being charged to the bidders on the books of the Purser. Having been present at this auction, though not a purchaser, and seeing with what facility the most dismantled old garments went off, through the magical cleverness of the accomplished auctioneer, the thought occurred to me, that if ever I calmly and positively decided to dispose of my famous white jacket, this would be the very way to do it. I turned the matter over in my mind a long time. The weather in <LOC> was genial and warm, and that I would ever again need such a thing as a heavy quilted jacket—and such a jacket as the white one, too—seemed almost impossible. Yet I remembered the American coast, and that it would probably be Autumn when we should arrive there. Yes, I thought of all that, to be sure; nevertheless, the ungovernable whim seized me to sacrifice my jacket and recklessly abide the consequences. Besides, was it not a horrible jacket? To how many annoyances had it subjected me? How many scrapes had it dragged me into? <PER>, had it not once jeopardised my very existence? And I had a dreadful presentiment that, if I persisted in retaining it, it would do so again. Enough! I will sell it, I muttered; and so muttering, I thrust my hands further down in my waistband, and walked the main-top in the stern concentration of an inflexible purpose. <DATE>, hearing that another auction was shortly to take place, I repaired to the office of the <ORG>’s steward, with whom I was upon rather friendly terms. After vaguely and delicately hinting at the object of my visit, I came roundly to the point, and asked him whether he could slip my jacket into one of the bags of clothes next to be sold, and so dispose of it by public auction. He kindly acquiesced and the thing was done. In due time all hands were again summoned round the main-mast; the <ORG>’s steward mounted his post, and the ceremony began. Meantime, I lingered out of sight, but still within hearing, on the gun-deck below, gazing up, <ORG>-perceived, at the scene.",HermanMelville,unknown,0.4479040205478668,,-5.7914018630981445

Scudding makes you a slave to the blast, which drives you headlong before it; but _running up into the wind’s eye_ enables you, in a degree, to hold it at bay.

A thing which every man in the ship had long suspected that night was proved true. Hitherto, in going about the ship, and casting his glances among the men, the peculiarly lustreless repose of the Captain’s eye—his slow, even, unnecessarily methodical step, and the forced firmness of his whole demeanour—though, to a casual observer, expressive of the consciousness of command and a desire to strike subjection among the crew—all this, to some minds, had only been deemed indications of the fact that Captain <PER>, while carefully shunning positive excesses, continually kept himself in an uncertain equilibrio between soberness and its reverse; which <ORG> might be destroyed by the <NUM> sharp vicissitude of events. And though this is only a surmise, nevertheless, as having some knowledge of brandy and mankind, White-Jacket will venture to state that, had Captain <PER> been an out-and-out temperance man, he would never have given that most imprudent order to _hard up_ the helm. He would either have held his peace, and stayed in his cabin, like his gracious majesty the <ORG>, or else have anticipated <PER>’s order, and thundered forth “Hard down the helm!” To show how little real sway at times have the severest restrictive laws, and how spontaneous is the instinct of discretion in some minds, it must here be added, that though <PER>, under a hot impulse, had countermanded an order of his superior officer before his very face, yet that severe Article of War, to which he thus rendered himself obnoxious, was never enforced against him.

It was not possible as yet to bring the common mind openly to the heights of those great doctrines of life and practice which the Wisdom of the <PER> also embodies, but the new teachers of that age knew how to appreciate, as the man of science only can fully appreciate, the worth of those motives that were then beginning to agitate so portentously so large a portion of the English people. The Elizabethan politicians nourished and patronised in secret that growing faction. The scientific politician hailed with secret delight, hailed as the partner of his own enterprise, that new element of political power which the changing time began to reveal here then, that power which was already beginning to unclasp on the necks of the masses, the collar of the absolute will--that was already proclaiming, in the stifled undertones of 'that greater part which carries it,' another supremacy.

But at the same time, this was a power which the wise men of that age were far from being willing to let loose upon society then in that stage of its development; very far were they from being willing to put the reins into its hands.

1385,"When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love. My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.

1388,"For the surprise of the monarch at the discoveries which this new state of things forces upon him,--the speeches he makes, with all the levelling of their philosophy, with all the unsurpassable boldness of their political criticism, are too natural and proper to the circumstances, to excite any surprise or question. Indeed, a king, who, nurtured in the flatteries of the palace, was unlearned enough in the nature of things, to suppose that _the name_ of a king was anything but a shadow when _the power_ which had sustained its prerogative was withdrawn,--a king who thought that he could still be a king, and maintain 'his state' and 'his <NUM> knights,' and their prerogatives, and all his old arbitrary, despotic humours, with their inevitable encroachment on the will and humours, and on the welfare of others, merely on grounds of respect and affection, or on grounds of duty, when not merely the care of 'the state,' but the revenues and power of it had been devolved on others--such a <NUM> appeared, indeed, to the poet, to be engaging in an experiment very similar to the one which he found in progress in his time, in that old, decayed, riotous form of military government, which had chosen the moment of its utter dependence on the popular will and respect, as the fitting one for its final suppression of the national liberties. It was an experiment which was, of course, modified in the play by some diverting and strongly pronounced differences, or it would not have been possible to produce it then; but it was still the experiment of _the unarmed prerogative_, that the old popular tale of the ancient king of <LOC> offered to the poet's hands, and that was an experiment which he was willing to see traced to its natural conclusion on paper at least; while in the subsequent development of the plot, the presence of an insulted trampled outcast majesty on the stage, furnishes a cover of which the poet is continually availing himself, for putting the case of that other outraged sovereignty, whose cause under one form or another, under all disguises, he is always pleading. And in the poet's hands, the debased and outcast king, becomes the impersonation of a debased and violated state, that had given all to its daughters,--the victim of a tyranny not less absolute, the victim, too, of a blindness and fatuity on its own part, not less monstrous, but not, not--_that_ is the poet's word--_not_ yet irretrievable.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9693381786346436,0.9693381786346436,-1.1936123371124268

1397,"Such a scene as has been described could not but have a powerful effect upon any one who retained aught of humanity; and the grief of the son, whose natural feelings had been blunted, but not destroyed, by an evil life, was much more violent than his outward demeanor would have expressed. But his deep repentance for the misery he had brought upon his parent did not produce in him a resolution to do wrong no more. The sudden consciousness of accumulated guilt made him desperate. He felt as if no one had thenceforth a claim to justice or compassion at his hands, when his neglect and cruelty had poisoned his mother's life, and hastened her death. Thus it was that the Devil wrought with him to his own destruction, reversing the salutary effect which his mother would have died exultingly to produce upon his mind.

And this is the key to this philosophy, not where it touches human nature only, but everywhere where it substitutes for abstract human notions--specific human notions that are powerless in the arts, or narrow observations that are restrained and uncertain in the rules of practice they produce,--powers, true forms, original agencies in nature, universal powers, sure as nature herself, and her universal form. To abase the specific human arrogance, to overthrow 'the idols of the tribe,' is the ultimate condition of this learning. Man _as man_, is not a primal, if he be an ultimate, fact in nature.

From the height of that new simplicity which this philosophy has gained--not as the elder philosophies had gained theirs, by pure contemplation, by hasty abstraction and retreat to the _à priori_ sources of knowledge and belief in man,--which it has gained, too, by a wider induction than the facts of the human nature can supply--with the torch of these universal principles cleared of their historic complexities, with the torch of the nature that is formed in everything, it enters here this great, unenclosed field of human life and practice, this <PER> wilderness, where those old, gnarled trunks, and tangled boughs, and wretched undergrowths of <DATE>, stop the way, where those old monsters, which the action of this play exposes, which this philosophy is bound to drag out to <DATE>, are hid.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9719247817993164,0.9719247817993164,-1.1048287153244019

1419,"I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, <PER>, and <PER>; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in <NUM> place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent. I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to <LOC>, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend <TIME> as I pleased. <TIME> I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil influence, <ORG>, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s door—led me <NUM> to <PER>, professor of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?” I replied in the affirmative. “<TIME>,” continued <PER> with warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. Good God!

1421,"“I'm sorry,” she began hesitatingly, “I never--I can't”--then she swallowed hard in her desperate plight. “Isn't it pretty?” she said rather breathlessly. “It's very good,” returned the housekeeper briefly, misconstruing the child's hesitation. “Shall I help you?” “I--could I have a drink of milk? I don't--I don't eat eggs.” “Don't eat eggs?” repeated the housekeeper severely. “I'm sorry you have been allowed to be notional. Children should eat what is set before them.

1422,"And getting hold of a foot or <NUM> of old cable, they would cut into it lovingly, to see whether it had any _“tenderloin.”_ For my own part, nevertheless, I can not say that this tit-bit was at all an agreeable one in the mouth; however pleasant to the sight of an antiquary, or to the nose of an epicure in nautical fragrancies. Indeed, though possibly I might have been mistaken, I thought it had rather an astringent, acrid taste; probably induced by the tar, with which the flavor of all ropes is more or less vitiated. But the sailors seemed to like it, and at any rate nibbled at it with great gusto. They converted <NUM> pocket of their trowsers into a junk-shop, and when solicited by a shipmate for a _“chaw,”_ would produce a small coil of rope. Another device adopted to alleviate their hardships, was the substitution of dried tea-leaves, in place of tobacco, for their pipes. No one has ever supped in a forecastle at sea, without having been struck by the prodigious residuum of tea-leaves, or cabbage stalks, in his tin-pot of bohea. There was no lack of material to supply every pipe-bowl among us. I had almost forgotten to relate the most noteworthy thing in this matter; namely, that notwithstanding the general scarcity of the genuine weed, <PER> was provided with a supply; nor did it give out, until very shortly previous to our arrival in port. In the lowest depths of despair at the loss of their precious solace, when the sailors would be seated inconsolable as the Babylonish captives, <PER> would sit cross-legged in his bunk, which was an upper one, and enveloped in a cloud of tobacco smoke, would look down upon the mourners below, with a sardonic grin at their forlornness. He recalled to mind their folly in selling for filthy lucre, their supplies of the weed; he painted their stupidity; he enlarged upon the sufferings they had brought upon themselves; he exaggerated those sufferings, and every way derided, reproached, twitted, and hooted at them. No one dared to return his scurrilous animadversions, nor did any presume to ask him to relieve their necessities out of his fullness. On the contrary, as has been just related, they divided with him the _nail-rods_ they found.

1429,"He appeared <DATE>, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget: “The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.” Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; <NUM> by <NUM> the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, <NUM> conception, <NUM> purpose.

By degrees, after the <TIME>’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.

1430,"And after having briefly indicated the comprehension 'of this science,' and shown that it is the thing he is treating under other heads, he concludes, 'but considering that _I write to a king_ who is a _master_ of it, and is _so well assisted_, I think it decent to pass over _this part_ in silence, as willing to obtain the certificate which <NUM> of the ancient philosophers aspired unto; who being silent when others contended to make demonstration of their abilities by speech, desired it might be certified for _his part_ that there was one that knew how to hold his peace.' And having thus distinctly cleared himself of any suspicion of a disposition to introduce scientific inquiry and innovation into departments not then open to a procedure of that sort, his proposal for an advancement of learning in other quarters was, of course, less liable to criticism. But even that part of the subject to which he limits himself involves, as we shall see, an incidental reference to this, from which he here so modestly retires, and affords no inconsiderable scope for that genius which was by nature so irresistibly impelled, in <NUM> way or another, to the criticism and reformation of the larger wholes. He retires from the open assault, but it is only to go deeper into his subject. He is constituting the science of that from which the state proceeds. He is analyzing the state, and searching out in the integral parts of it, that which makes true _states_ impossible. He has found the revolutionary forces in their simple forms, and is content to treat them in these. He is bestowing all his pains upon an art that will develop--on scientific principles, by simply attending to the natural laws, as they obtain in the human kind, royalties, and nobilities, and liege-men of all degrees--an art that will make all kinds of pieces that the structure of the state requires. <PER>.

A logic in which the general 'notions of nature' which are _causes_, powers, simple powers, elemental powers, true differences, are substituted for those spontaneous, rude, uncorrected, _specific_ notions,--_pre_-notions of men, which have in that form, as they stand thus, no correlative in nature, and are therefore impotent--not true _terms_ and _forms_, but air-words, air-lines, merely. It is a logic which includes the Mind of NATURE, and her laws; and not one which is limited to the mind of _Man_, and so fitted to its _incapacity_ as to nurse him in his natural ignorance, to educate him in his born <ORG> and conceit, to teach him to ignore by rule, and set at nought the infinite mystery of nature. The universal history, all of it that the mind of man is constituted to grasp, is here in the general, under these <ORG> INSTANCES, in the luminous order of the Inventor of this science, blazing throughout with his genius, and the mind that has abolished its prenotions, and renounced its rude, instinctive, barbaric tendencies, and has taken this scientific <PER> instead; has armed itself with the Nature of Things, and is prepared to grapple with all specifications and particulars. The author tells us plainly, that those seemingly pedantic arrangements with which he is compelled to perplex his subject in this great work of his, the work in which he openly introduces HIS INNOVATION,--as that--will fall off by and by, when there is no longer any need of them. They are but the natural guards with which great Nature, working in the instinct of the philosophic genius, protects her choicest growth,--the husk of that grain which must have times, and a time to grow in,--the bark which the sap must stop to build, ere its delicate works within are safe.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9855867624282837,0.9855867624282837,-0.3593117892742157
1461,"And thus it is, that the demons of human life go abroad here still, impervious alike to our banning and our blessing. The powers of nature which are included in the human nature,--the powers which in this _specific_ form of them we are undertaking to manage with these vulgar generalizations, tacked together with the Aristotelian logic--these powers are no more amenable to any such treatment in this form, than they are in those other forms, in which we are learning to approach them with another vocabulary. The forces which are developed in the human life will not answer to the names by which we call them _here_, any more than the lightning would answer to the old <ORG> incantation,--any more than it would have come if the old Logician had called it by _his_ name,--which was just as good as the name--and no better, than the name, which the priest of <LOC> gave it,--any more than it would have come, if the old Logician had undertaken to fetch it, with the harness of his syllogism. But when the new Logician, who was the new Magician, came, with 'the part operative' of his speculation; with his '<ORG>,' with the rod of his new definition, with the staff of _his_ genera and species,--when the right name was found for it, it heard, it heard afar, it heard in its heaven and _came_. It came fast enough then. It was 'asleep,' but it awaked. It was 'taking a journey' but it came. There was no affectation of the graces of the gods when the new interpreter and prophet of nature, who belonged to the new order of Interpreters, sent up his little messenger, without any pomp or ceremony, or 'windy suspiration of forced breath,' and fetched it. But that was an Occidental philosopher, <NUM> of the race who like to see effects of some kind, when there is nothing in the field to forbid it. That was <NUM> of the Doctors who are called in this system 'Interpreters of nature,' to distinguish them from those who 'rashly anticipate' it.

1462,"Pleasant, though vague visions of future opulence floated before me, as I commenced the <NUM> chapter, entitled _“Of the causes of improvement in the productive power of labor.”_ Dry as crackers and cheese, to be sure; and the chapter itself was not much better. But this was only getting initiated; and if I read on, the grand secret would be opened to me. So I read on and on, about _“wages and profits of labor,”_ without getting any profits myself for my pains in perusing it. Dryer and dryer; the very leaves smelt of saw-dust; till at last I drank some water, and went at it again. But soon I had to give it up for lost work; and thought that the old backgammon board, we had at home, lettered on the back, _“The History of Rome”_ was quite as full of matter, and a great deal more entertaining. I wondered whether Mr. <PER> had ever read the volume himself; and could not help remembering, that he had to get on a chair when he reached it down from its dusty shelf; _that_ certainly looked suspicious. The best reading was on the fly leaves; and, on turning them over, I lighted upon some half effaced pencil-marks to the following effect: _“<PER>, from his particular friend <PER>,_ <DATE>.” So it must have originally belonged to Mr. <PER>’ father; and I wondered whether _he_ had ever read it; or, indeed, whether any body had ever read it, even the author himself; but then authors, they say, never read their own books; writing them, being enough in all conscience. At length I fell asleep, with the volume in my hand; and never slept so sound before; after that, I used to wrap my jacket round it, and use it for a pillow; for which purpose it answered very well; only I sometimes waked up feeling dull and stupid; but of course the book could not have been the cause of that. And now I am talking of books, I must tell of <PER> the sailor, and his Dream Book. <PER>, who seemed to know every thing about all parts of the world, used to tell <PER> in reproach, that he was an _Irish Cockney._ By which I understood, that he was an Irishman born, but had graduated in <LOC>, somewhere about <PER>; but he had no sort of brogue that I could hear.",HermanMelville,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9513435959815979,0.9513435959815979,-2.5817387104034424
1463,"They wanted some organ of communication with these so potent and resistless rulers--some 'chair' from which they could repeat to them in their own tongue the story of their lost institutions, and revive in them the memory of '_the kings_ their ancestors'--some school in which they could collect them and instruct them in the scientific doctrine of the _commons_, the doctrine of the <DATE>_ and its divine supremacy. They wanted a school in which they could tell them stories--stories of various kinds--such stories as they loved best to hear--Midsummer stories, or <DATE>'s tales, and stories of their own battle-fields--they wanted a school in which they could teach the common people _History_ (and not English history only), with illustrations, large as life, and a magic lantern to aid them,--'visible history.' But to wait till these slow methods had taken effect, would be, perhaps, to wait, not merely till their estate in the earth was done, but till the mischief they wished to avert was accomplished. And thus it was, that the proposal 'to go the beaten track of getting arms into their hands under colour of Caesar's designs, and _because the people understood them not_,' came to be considered. To permit the new dynasty to come in without making any terms with it, without insisting upon a definition of that indefinite power which the <ORG> had wielded with impunity, and without challenge, would be to make needless work for the future, and to ignore criminally the responsibilities of their own position, so at least some English statesmen of that time, fatally for their favour with the new monarch, were known to have thought. 'To proceed by process,' to check by gradual constitutional measures that overgrown and monstrous power in the state, was the project which these statesmen had most at heart. But that was a movement which required a firm and enlightened popular support. Charters and statutes were dead letters till that could be had. It was fatal to attempt it till that was secured. Failing in that popular support, if the statesman who had attempted that movement, if the illustrious chief, and chief man of his time, who headed it, did secretly meditate other means for accomplishing the same end--which was to limit the prerogative--such means as the time offered, and if the evidence which was wanting on his trial _had been_ produced in proof of it, who that knows what that crisis was would undertake to convict him on it now?

1464,"<DATE> was a full-blooded “_bull-negro_,” so the sailors called him, with a skull like an iron tea-kettle, wherefore <DATE> much fancied the sport. But Rose-water, he was a slender and rather handsome mulatto, and abhorred the pastime. Nevertheless, the Captain must be obeyed; so at the word poor Rose-water was fain to put himself in a posture of defence, else <DATE> would incontinently have bumped him out of a port-hole into the sea. I used to pity poor Rose-water from the bottom of my heart. But my pity was almost aroused into indignation at a sad sequel to one of these gladiatorial scenes. It seems that, lifted up by the unaffected, though verbally unexpressed applause of the Captain, <DATE> had begun to despise <PER>-water as a poltroon—a fellow all brains and no skull; whereas he himself was a great warrior, all skull and no brains. Accordingly, after they had been bumping <TIME> to the Captain’s content, <DATE> confidentially told Rose-water that he considered him a “_nigger_,” which, among some blacks, is held a great term of reproach. Fired at the insult, Rose-water gave <DATE> to understand that he utterly erred; for his mother, a black slave, had been one of the mistresses of a <LOC> planter belonging to one of the oldest families in that state. Another insulting remark followed this innocent disclosure; retort followed retort; in a word, at last they came together in mortal combat. The master-at-arms caught them in the act, and brought them up to the mast. The Captain advanced. “Please, sir,” said poor Rose-water, “it all came of dat ’ar bumping; <DATE>, here, aggrawated me ’bout it.” “Master-at-arms,” said the Captain, “did you see them fighting?” “Ay, sir,” said the master-at-arms, touching his cap. “Rig the gratings,” said the Captain. “I’ll teach you <NUM> men that, though I now and then permit you to _play_, I will have no _fighting_.

1466,"'Those times are the ancient times, when the _world_ is ancient and not those we account ancient by a computation _backward_ from _ourselves_.' --_Advancement of Learning_. But that was put down in a book in which we have only general statements, very wise indeed, and both new and true, most exactly true, but not ready for practice, as the author stops to tell us, and it is practice he is aiming at. That is from a book in which we have only 'the husks and shells of sciences, _all the kernel_ being forced out,' as the author informs us, 'by the _torture and press_ of the method.' But it was a method which saved them, notwithstanding. This is the book that contains the 'nuts,' and _this_ is the kernel that goes in that particular shell or a corner of it, '_<ORG> seculi <PER>_.' There, on the spot, he shows us the process by which a king,--an historic king,--is made. He detects and brings out and blazons, the moment in which the inequality of fortune begins, in the division of the spoils of victory. His hero is _not_, as he takes pains to tell us, covetous,--_unless_ it be a sin to covet honour, if it be, he is the most offending soul alive;--it is because he is not mercenary, that his soldiers will enrich him. The poet shows us where the throne begins, and the machinery of that engine which the earth shrinks from when it moves. On his stage, it is the moment in which, the soldiers raise their victorious leader from his feet, and carry him in triumph above them. We are there at the ceremony, for this is selected, illuminated history; this, too, is what he calls 'visible history,' but amid all those martial acclamations and plaudits, the philosopher contrives to get in a word. 'He that has effected his _good will_, has o'ertaken my act.' From the field he tracks his hero to the chair of state. <NUM> we have the news of the victory in the city, and its effect:-- 'I'll report it Where _senators_ shall mingle tears with smiles; Where great _patricians_ shall attend, and _shrug_; I' the end admire; where ladies shall be frighted, And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the _dull tribunes_, That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours, <PER> say against their hearts, We thank the gods _Our <LOC>_ hath such a soldier.'",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9961274266242981,0.9961274266242981,-1.2653319835662842
1469,"It was thus with all the fine quintessences of ancient lore, with all the pearl-like accretions of the faiths and fancies of the old world: they were handled about freely as a kind of curious but not so very rare coins, which found no currency in the deeper thoughts of our modern humanity, and could therefore be used as a mere badge of the learning and taste of a literary ‘coterie’. The very names of the ancient gods and heroes were in fact assuming that abstract anaemic look which common nouns have in everyday language. Thus, when <PER>, in his verses _Upon a Lady’s Embroidery_, mentions ‘Arachne’, it is obvious that he does not expect the reader to think of the daring challenger of <PER>’s art, or the Princess of Lydia, but just of a plain spider. And again, when <PER>, in his early _<PER> on the death of the Prince of Wales_, expresses a rhetorical wish ‘to aid hoarse howling Boreas with his sighs,’ that particular son of <ORG>, whose love for the nymph Orithyia was long unsuccessful, because he could not ‘sigh’, is surely far from the poet’s mind; and ‘to swell the wind’, or ‘the gale’, would have served his turn quite as well, though less ‘elegantly’. Even <ORG>, with all his partiality for whatever was pre- or post- Christian, had indeed no better word than ‘elegant’ for the ancient mythologies of <LOC> and <LOC>, and he surely reflected no particularly advanced opinion when he praised and damned, in <NUM> breath, ‘the pleasant and absurd system of Paganism.’ No wonder if in <DATE>, and for a long time after, the passionate giants of the Ages of Fable had dwindled down to the pretty puppets with which the daughters of the gentry had to while away many <TIME>.

The engine stopped, stooped, and dived almost as deliberately as a man bathing; in their downward rush they swept within fifty yards of a big bulk of stone that <PER> knew only too well. The last red anger of the sunset was ended; the dome of heaven was dark; the lanes of flaring light in the streets below hardly lit up the base of the building. But he saw that it was <PER> Cathedral, and he saw that on the top of it the ball was still standing erect, but the cross was stricken and had fallen sideways. Then only he cared to look down into the streets, and saw that they were inflamed with uproar and tossing passions. “We arrive at a happy moment,” said the man steering the ship. “The insurgents are bombarding the city, and a cannon-ball has just hit the cross. Many of the insurgents are simple people, and they naturally regard it as a happy omen.” “Quite so,” said <PER>, in a rather colourless voice. “Yes,” replied the other. “I thought you would be glad to see your prayer answered. Of course I apologize for the word prayer.” “Don't mention it,” said <PER>. The flying ship had come down upon a sort of curve, and was now rising again. The higher and higher it rose the broader and broader became the scenes of flame and desolation underneath. <ORG> indeed had been an uncaptured and comparatively quiet height, altered only by the startling coincidence of the cross fallen awry. All the other thoroughfares on all sides of that hill were full of the pulsation and the pain of battle, full of shaking torches and shouting faces. When at length they had risen high enough to have a bird's-eye view of the whole campaign, <PER> was already intoxicated. He had smelt gunpowder, which was the incense of his own revolutionary religion. “Have the people really risen?” he asked, breathlessly. “What are they fighting about?” “The programme is rather elaborate,” said his entertainer with some indifference. “I think Dr. <PER> drew it up.” <PER> wrinkled his forehead. “Are all the poor people with the Revolution?” he asked. The other shrugged his shoulders. “All the instructed and class-conscious part of them without exception,” he replied.",Chesterton,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9953004121780396,0.9953004121780396,-0.5243990421295166
1484,"Who, that is himself at all above the condition of an oyster, will undertake to say, deliberately and upon reflection, that it is not? So long as we have that one fact in our possession, it is absurd, it is simply disgraceful, to complain of any deficiency in this person's biography. There is enough of it and to spare. With that fact in our possession, we ought to have been able to dispense long ago with some, at least, of those details that we have of it. The only fault to be found with the biography of this individual as it stands at present is, that there is too much of it, and the public mind is labouring under a plethora of information. If that fact be not enough, it is our own fault and not the author's. He was perfectly willing to lie by, till it was. He would not take the trouble to come out for a time that had not studied his philosophy enough to find it, and to put the books of it together. Many years afterwards, the author of this work on <ORG>, saw occasion to recast it, and put it in another language. But though he has had so long a time to think about it, and though he does not appear to have taken a single step in the interval, towards the supplying of this radical deficiency in human science; we do not find that his views of its importance are at all altered. It is still the <NUM> point with him in the scientific culture of human nature,--the <NUM> point in that <ORG>, which is the end and term of _Natural Philosophy_, as _he_ understands the limits of it. We still find the <NUM> Article of the Culture of the Mind put down, 'THE DIFFERENT NATURES OR DISPOSITIONS OF MEN,' _not the vulgar propensities_ to VIRTUES and VICES--note it--'or perturbations and passions, but of such as are _more internal and radical_, which are generally neglected.' 'This is a study,' he says, which 'might afford GREAT LIGHT TO THE SCIENCES.' And again he refers us to the existing supply, such as it is, and repeats with some amplification, his previous suggestions. 'In astrological traditions, the natures and dispositions of men, are tolerably _distinguished_ according to the influence of the planets, where _some_ are said to be by nature formed for _contemplation, others_ for _war_, others for _politics_.'",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9611464142799377,0.9611464142799377,-1.5532660484313965
1487,"But in reading this truly interesting document from the pen of an Elizabethan player, who _has_ left us a specimen of his use of that instrument usually so much in esteem with men of letters, we must take into account the fact, that _this_ is an exceptional case of culture. It is the case of a player who aspired to distinction, and who had raised himself by the force of his genius above his original social level; it is the case of a player who has been referred to recently as a proof of the position which it was possible for 'a stage player' to attain to under those particular social conditions. But as this letter is of a specially private and confidential nature, and as this poor player who _did_ care for the future, and who founded with his talents, such as they were, a noble charity, instead of living and dying to himself, is not to blame for his defects of education,--since his _acts_ command our respect, however faulty his attempts at literary expression,--this letter will not be produced here. But whoever has read it, or whoever may chance to read it, in the course of an antiquarian research, will be apt to infer, that whatever educational bias the <NUM> efforts of genius subjected to influences of the same kind would naturally betray, the faults charged upon the Comedy of Errors, the leaning to the classics, the taint of <ORG>, the tone of the <PER>'s scholars, are hardly the faults that the instructed critic would look for. But to ascertain the fact, that the controlling idea of that new learning which the Man in the <ORG> is illustrating now in so grand and mature a manner, not with his pen only, but with his 'living art,' and with such an entire independence of classic models, is already organically contained in those earlier works on which the classic shell is still visible, it is not necessary to go back to the <LOC> play of these new classics, or to the performances of the Queen's Scholars. Plays having a considerable air of maturity, in which the internal freedom of judgment and taste is already absolute, still exhibit on the surface of them this remarkable submission to the ancient forms which are afterwards rejected on principle, and by a rule in the new rhetoric--a rule which the author of <ORG> is at pains to state very clearly. The _wildness_ of which we hear so much, works itself out upon the surface, and determines the form at length, as these players proceed and grow bolder with their work.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9580757021903992,0.9580757021903992,-1.6726648807525635

The other seemed to take no notice, but reverted to the main topic. “In our armies up in heaven we learn to put a wholesome fear into subordinates.” MacIan sat craning his neck forward with an extraordinary and unaccountable eagerness. “Go on!” he cried, twisting and untwisting his long, bony fingers, “go on!” “Besides,” continued he, in the prow, “you must allow for a certain high spirit and haughtiness in the superior type.” “Go on!” said <PER>, with burning eyes. “Just as the sight of sin offends God,” said the unknown, “so does the sight of ugliness offend <ORG>.

As he spoke, they had approached close to the subject of their conversation; and <PER> had a moment's space for observation before he started from the abstraction in which he was plunged. The result of her scrutiny was favorable, yet very painful. The stranger could scarcely have attained his <DATE>, and was possessed of a face and form such as Nature bestows on none but her favorites. There was a nobleness on his high forehead, which time would have deepened into majesty; and all his features were formed with a strength and boldness, of which the paleness, produced by study and confinement, could not deprive them. The expression of his countenance was not a melancholy one: on the contrary, it was proud and high, perhaps triumphant, like one who was a ruler in a world of his own, and independent of the beings that surrounded him. But a blight, of which his thin pale cheek, and the brightness of his eye, were alike proofs, seemed to have come over him ere his maturity. The scholar's attention was now aroused by the hoof-tramps at his side; and, starting, he fixed his eyes on <PER>, whose young and lovely countenance was full of the interest he had excited. A deep blush immediately suffused his cheek, proving how well the glow of health would have become it. There was nothing awkward, however, in his manner; and, soon recovering his self-possession, he bowed to her, and would have rode on. ""Your ride is unusually long to-day, <PER>,"" observed <PER>. ""When may we look for your return?"" The young man again blushed, but answered, with a smile that had a beautiful effect upon his countenance, ""I was not, at the moment, aware in which direction my horse's head was turned.

1503,"[But _this_ hero's conclusion for himself, and his impulsive nature is--] 'Not of a woman's tenderness to be, Requires nor child, nor woman's face to see. I have sat too long.' But the mother will not let him go, and her stormy eloquence completes the conquest which that dumb rhetoric had before well nigh achieved. Yes, <ORG> was right in his induction. His abstraction and brief summing up of 'this Volumnia' and her history, is the true one. She is very potent in the business of the state, whether you take her in her <NUM> literal acceptation, as the representative mother, or whether you take her in that symbolical and allusive comprehension, to which the emphasis on the name is not unfrequently made to point, as 'the nurse and mother of all humanities,' the instructor of the state, the former of its nobility, who _in_-forms their thoughts with nobleness, such nobleness, and such notions of it as they have, and who fits them for the place they are to occupy in the body of the common-weal. <ORG> has not exaggerated in his exposition the relative importance of _this_ figure among those which the dumb-show of this play exhibits. Among the 'transient hieroglyphics' which the diseased common-weal produces on the scientific stage, when the question of its CURE is the question of the Play--in that great crowd of forms, in that moving, portentous, stormy pageant of senators, and consuls, and tribunes, and plebeians, whose great acts fill the scene--there are none more significant than these <NUM>, whom we saw at <NUM> 'seated on <NUM> low stools, sewing'; these <NUM> of the wife and mother--the commanding mother, and the 'gracious silence.'

To its utmost bound of consequences, she is the mother of it, and accountable to God and man for its growth and continuance. Consuls, and senators, and patricians, and tribunes, such as we have, are powerless without her, are powerless against her. The state begins with her; but, instead of it, she has bred and nursed the destroyer of the state. Let her conquer him, though her life-blood must flow for it now.

1512,"This _hero_, who 'speaks of the people as if he were a _god_ to punish, and not a man of their infirmity,' is on trial for that pretension from the <NUM> scene of this Play to the last. The author has, indeed, his own views of the fickle, ignorant, foolish multitude,--such views as any one, who had occasion to experiment on it personally, in the age of <PER>, would not lack the means of acquiring; and amidst those ebullitions of wrath, which he pours from his haughty hero's lips, one hears at times a tone that sounds a little like some other things from the same source, as if the author had himself, in some way, been brought to look at the subject from a point of observation, not altogether unlike that from which his hero speaks; or as if he might, at least, have known how to sympathise with the haughty and unbending nature, that had been brought into such deadly collision with it. But in the dramatic representation, though it is far from being a flattering one, we listen in vain for any echo of this sentiment. In its rich and kindly humour there is no sneer, no satire. It is the loving eye of nature's own great pupil--it is the kindly human eye, that comes near enough to point those jests, and paint so truly; there is a great human heart here in the scene embracing the lowly. It was the heart that was putting forth then its silent but resistless energies into <DATE> of the human advancement, to take up the despised and rejected masses of men from their misery, and make of them truly one _kind_ and kindred. And though he has had, indeed, his own private experiences with the multitude, and the passions are, as he intimates--at least as strong in him as in another, he has his own view, also, of the common pitifulness and weakness of the human conditions; and he has a view which is, in his time, all his own, of the instrumentalities that are needed to reach that level of human nature, and to lift men up from the mire of these conditions, from the wrong and wretchedness into which, in their unaided, unartistic, unlearned struggle with nature,--within and without,--_the kind_ are fallen. And so strong in him is the sense of this pitifulness, that it predominates over the sharpness of his genius, and throws the divinest mists and veils of compassion over the harsh, scientific realities he is constrained to lay bare.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.8361111879348755,0.8361111879348755,-3.6867189407348633

1530,"You are not making collections!” “I’m fond of the article,” said the Lieutenant; “it’s a fine cold relish to bacon or ham. You know, I was in <LOC> last cruise, <ORG>, and got into sad dissipation there among the cannibals; come, let’s have a bit, if it’s only a mouthful.” “Why, you infernal <PER>!” shouted <ORG>, eyeing the other with a confounded expression; “you don’t really mean to eat a piece of this cancer?” “Hand it to me, and see whether I will not,” was the reply. “In God’s name, take it!” cried the <ORG>, putting the case into his hands, and then standing with his own uplifted. “<PER>!” cried the Lieutenant, “the castor—quick! I always use plenty of pepper with this dish, Surgeon; it’s oystery. Ah! this is really delicious,” he added, smacking his lips over a mouthful. “Try it now, <ORG>, and you’ll never keep such a fine dish as this, lying uneaten on your hands, as a mere scientific curiosity.” Cuticle’s whole countenance changed; and, slowly walking up to the table, he put his nose close to the tin case, then touched its contents with his finger and tasted it. Enough. Buttoning up his coat, in all the tremblings of an old man’s rage he burst from the ward-room, and, calling for a boat, was not seen again for <TIME>. But though, like all other mortals, <ORG> was subject at times to these fits of passion—at least under outrageous provocation—nothing could exceed his coolness when actually employed in his imminent vocation. Surrounded by moans and shrieks, by features distorted with anguish inflicted by himself, he yet maintained a countenance almost supernaturally calm; and unless the intense interest of the operation flushed his wan face with a momentary tinge of professional enthusiasm, he toiled away, untouched by the keenest misery coming under a fleet-surgeon’s eye. Indeed, long habituation to the dissecting-room and the amputation-table had made him seemingly impervious to the ordinary emotions of humanity. Yet you could not say that <ORG> was essentially a cruel-hearted man. His apparent heartlessness must have been of a purely scientific origin.

1532,"The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever. Chapter 23 It was <DATE> when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines. The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended. I had been calm during <DATE>, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, <NUM> fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished. <PER> observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear <PER>? What is it you fear?” “Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “<TIME>, and all will be safe; but <TIME> is dreadful, very dreadful.” I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy. She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which <PER> had retired.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9873756170272827,0.9873756170272827,-0.8904222249984741
1533,"There is another natural curiosity, which strikes the eye of the founder of the Science of Nature, as quite the most curious and wonderful thing going, so far, at least, as his observation has extended, though he is willing to make, as he takes pains to state, philosophical allowance for the partiality of species in determining this judgment, and is perfectly willing to concede, that if any particular species of shell-fish, for instance, were to undertake a science of things in general, that particular species would, no doubt, occupy the principal place in that system; especially if arts, tending to the improvement and elevation of it, were necessarily based on this larger specific knowledge. Men, and their proceedings and organisms, men, and their habits and modes of combining, did appear to the eye of this scientific observer quite as well worth observing and noting, also, as bees and beavers, for instance, and their societies; and, accordingly, he made some observations himself, and notes, too, in this particular department of his general science. For, as he tells us elsewhere, he did not wish to map out the large fields of the science of observation in general, and exhibit to the world, in bare description, the method of it, without leaving some specimens of his own, of what might be done with it, in proper hands, under favourable circumstances, selecting for his experiments the principal and noblest subjects--those of the most immediate human concern. And he has not only very carefully laboured a few of these; but he has taken extraordinary pains to preserve them to us in their proper scientific form, with just as little of the ligature of the time on them as it was possible to leave. It is no kind of beetle or butterfly, then, that this philosopher comes down upon here from the heights of his universal science--his science of the nature of things in general, but that great Spenserian monstrosity,--that diseased product of nature, which individual human nature, in spite of its natural pettiness and helplessness, under certain favourable conditions of absorption and accretion, may be made to yield. It is that dragon of lawless power which was overspreading, in his time, all the common human affairs, and infolding in its gaudy, baleful wings all the life of men,--it is that which takes from the <NUM> the speculative eye of this new speculator,--this founder of the science of things, and not of words instead of them.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9840453863143921,0.9840453863143921,-0.4779769778251648
1536,"You now forbid me the promenade, a thing necessary to a person of my age. It is useless to tell me that you do all this by law. Law rests upon the social contract. If the citizen finds himself despoiled of such pleasures and powers as he would have had even in the savage state, the social contract is annulled.” “It's no good chattering away, <ORG>,” said <PER>, for the Master was silent. “The place is covered with machine-guns. We've got to obey our orders, and so have you.” “The machinery is of the most perfect,” assented <ORG>, somewhat irrelevantly; “worked by petroleum, I believe. I only ask you to admit that if such things fall below the comfort of barbarism, the social contract is annulled. It is a pretty little point of theory.” “Oh! I dare say,” said <PER>. <ORG> bowed quite civilly and withdrew. “A cosy party,” resumed the Master, scornfully, “and yet I believe some of you are in doubt about how we all came together. I will explain it, ladies and gentlemen; I will explain everything. To whom shall I specially address myself? To Mr. <PER>. He has a scientific mind.” <PER> seemed to choke with sudden protest. The Master seemed only to cough out of pure politeness and proceeded: “Mr. <PER> will agree with me,” he said, “when I say that we long felt in scientific circles that great harm was done by such a legend as that of the Crucifixion.” <PER> growled something which was presumably assent. The Master went on smoothly: “It was in vain for us to urge that the incident was irrelevant; that there were many such fanatics, many such executions. We were forced to take the thing thoroughly in hand, to investigate it in the spirit of scientific history, and with the assistance of Mr. <PER> and others we were happy in being able to announce that this alleged Crucifixion never occurred at all.” MacIan lifted his head and looked at the Master steadily, but <PER> did not look up. “This, we found, was the only way with all superstitions,” continued the speaker; “it was necessary to deny them historically, and we have done it with great success in the case of miracles and such things.",Chesterton,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9950624108314514,0.9950624108314514,-0.27156201004981995
1537,"There was also another feeling, apparently discordant with those which have been enumerated. It was a longing for rest, for his old retirement, that came at intervals so powerfully upon him, as he rode on, that his heart sickened of the active exertion on which fate had thrust him. After being overtaken by <PER>, <PER> continued his journey with as much speed as was attainable by his wearied horse, but at a pace infinitely too slow for his earnest thoughts. These had carried him far away, leaving him only such a consciousness of his present situation as to make diligent use of the spur, when a horse's tread at no great distance struck upon his ear. He looked forward and behind; but, though a considerable extent of the narrow, rocky, and grass-grown road was visible, he was the only traveller there. Yet again he heard the sound, which, he now discovered, proceeded from among the trees that lined the roadside. Alighting, he entered the forest, with the intention, if the steed proved to be disengaged, and superior to his own, of appropriating him to his own use. He soon gained a view of the object he sought; but the animal rendered a closer acquaintance unattainable, by immediately taking to his heels. <PER> had, however, made a most interesting discovery; for the horse was accoutred with a side-saddle; and who but <PER> could have been his rider? At this conclusion, though his perplexity was thereby in no degree diminished, the student immediately arrived. Returning to the road, and perceiving on the summit of the hill a cottage, which he recognized as the one he had entered with <PER> and <PER>, he determined there to make inquiry respecting the objects of his pursuit. On reaching the door of the poverty-stricken dwelling, he saw that it was not now so desolate of inmates as on his previous visit. In the single inhabitable apartment were several elderly women, clad evidently in their well-worn and well-saved <DATE> clothes, and all wearing a deep grievous expression of countenance. <PER> was not long in deciding that death was within the cottage, and that these aged females were of the class who love the house of mourning, because to them it is a house of feasting. It is a fact, disgusting and lamentable, that the disposition which Heaven, for the best of purposes, has implanted in the female breast--to watch by the sick and comfort the afflicted--frequently becomes depraved into an odious love of scenes of pain and death and sorrow. Such women are like the Ghouls of the Arabian Tales, whose feasting was among tombstones and upon dead carcasses.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9868777394294739,0.9868777394294739,-0.148457333445549

It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly. This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of <NUM> of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings. “Are you better now, sir?” said she. I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.” “For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.” I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality. As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.

She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep.

At this time (<PER>’s wars), according to “Steel’s List,” there were <NUM> regular press-gang stations in <LOC>. Besides this domestic kidnapping, British frigates, in friendly or neutral harbours, in some instances pressed into their service foreign sailors of all nations from the public wharves. In certain cases, where Americans were concerned, when “_protections_” were found upon their persons, these were destroyed; and to prevent the American consul from claiming his sailor countrymen, the press-gang generally went on shore <TIME> previous to the sailing of the frigate, so that the kidnapped seamen were far out to sea before they could be missed by their friends. These things should be known; for in case the English government again goes to war with its fleets, and should again resort to indiscriminate impressment to man them, it is well that both Englishmen and Americans, that all the world be prepared to put down an iniquity outrageous and insulting to God and man.

1562,"This man was not wanting in any of the common natural sentiments; the private and particular nature was large in him, and that good to which he gives the preference in his comparison of those exclusive aims and enjoyments, is 'the good which is _active_, and not that which is _passive_'; both as it tends to secure that individual perpetuity which is the especial craving of men thus specially endowed, and on account of 'that affection for variety and _proceeding_' which is also common to men, and specially developed in such men,--an affection which the goods of the passive nature are not able to satisfy. 'But in _enterprises_, pursuits and purposes of life, there is much variety whereof men are sensible with pleasure in their inceptions, progressions, recoils, re-integration, approaches and attainings to their ends.' And he gives us a long insight into his own particular nature and history in that sentence. He is careful to distinguish this kind of good from the good of society, 'though in some cases it hath an incident to it. For that gigantine state of mind which possesseth the _troublers_ of the world, such as was <PER>, and _infinite other in smaller model_, who would have all men happy or unhappy, as they were their friends or enemies, _and would give form to the world according to their own humours_, which is the true _theomachy_, <LOC> and aspireth to _active good_ though it _recedeth farthest_ from that _good of society_, which we have determined to be _the greater_.' In no troubler or benefactor of the world, on the largest scale, in no theomachist of any age, whether intelligent and benevolent, or demoniacal and evil, had this nature which he here defines so clearly, ever been more largely incorporated, or more effectively armed. But in him this tendency to personal aggrandisement was overlooked, and subordinated by the larger nature,--by the intelligence which includes the whole, and is able to weigh the part with it, and by the sentiments which enforce or anticipate intelligent decision. Both these facts must be taken into the account, if we would read his history fairly. For he composed for himself a plan of living, in which this naturally intense desire for an individual perpetuity and renown, and this love of action and enterprise for its own sake, was sternly subordinated to the noblest ends of living, to the largest good of his kind, to the divine and eternal law of duty, to the relief of man's estate and the Creator's glory.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9834163188934326,0.9834163188934326,-0.47684189677238464

The delicate graces of those flowery summits of speech which the ideal nature, when it energises in speech, creates, must overhang in this design the rude actuality which the untrained nature in man, forgotten of art, is always producing. And it is the might of nature in this opposition, it is the force of 'matter,' it is the unconquerable cause contrasted with the vanity of the words that have not comprehended the _cause_, it is the futility of these heights of words that are not '_forms_' that do not correspond to things which must be exhibited here also.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9483281970024109,0.9483281970024109,-1.7179772853851318

1593,"Catulus Luctatius, in the Cymbrian war, having done all that in him lay to make his flying soldiers face about upon the enemy, _ran himself at last away with the rest, and counterfeited the coward_, to the end that his men might rather seem to follow their captain, than to fly from the enemy; and after several anecdotes full of that inner significance of which he speaks elsewhere, in which he appears, but only appears, to lose sight of this question of literary honour, for they relate to _military_ conflicts, he ventures to approach, somewhat cautiously and delicately, the latent point of his essay again, by adducing the example of persons, _not_ connected with the military profession, who have found themselves called upon in various ways, and by means of various weapons, to take part in these wars; who have yet, in consequence of certain '_subtleties of conscience_,' _relinquished_ the _honour_ of their successes; and though there is no instance adduced of that particular kind of disinterestedness, in which an author relinquishes to another the honour of his title page, as the beginning might have led one to anticipate; on the whole, the not indiligent reader of this author's performances here and elsewhere, will feel that the subject which is announced as the subject of this chapter, 'Not to communicate a man's honour or glory,' has been, considering the circumstance, sufficiently illustrated.

Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer.

1606,"But <NUM> person has been known to attempt the ascent of <DATE>, and <NUM> the descent; yet, steep as is the height, trees and bushes of various kinds have clung to the rock, wherever their roots could gain the slightest hold; thus seeming to prefer the scanty and difficult nourishment of the cliff to a more luxurious life in the rich interval that extends from its base to the river. But, whether or no these hardy vegetables have voluntarily chosen their rude resting-place, the cliff is indebted to them for much of the beauty that tempers its sublimity. When the eye is pained and wearied by the bold nakedness of the rock, it rests with pleasure on the cheerful foliage of the birch, or upon the darker green of the funereal pine. Just at the termination of the accessible portion of the crag, these trees are so numerous, and their foliage so dense, that they completely shroud from view a considerable excavation, formed, probably, <DATE> since, by the fall of a portion of the rock. The detached fragment still lies at a little distance from the base, gray and moss-grown, but corresponding, in its general outline, to the cavity from which it was rent.

Its perpendicular descent is of many feet; after which it finds its way, with a sweet diminutive murmur, to the level ground. It is not easy to conceive whence the barren rock procures even the small supply of water that is necessary to the existence of this stream; it is as unaccountable as the gush of gentle feeling which sometimes proceeds from the hardest heart: but there it continues to flow and fall, undiminished and unincreased. The stream is so slender, that the gentlest breeze suffices to disturb its descent, and to scatter its pure sweet waters over the face of the cliff. But in that deep forest there is seldom a breath of wind; so that, plashing continually upon one spot, the fount has worn its own little channel of white sand, by which it finds its way to the river. Alas that the <ORG> have lost their old authority! for what a deity of tiny loveliness must once have presided here! <PER>'s companion paused not to gaze either upon the loveliness or the sublimity of this scene, but, assisting her where it was requisite, began the steep and difficult ascent of the lower part of the cliff.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9871593713760376,0.9871593713760376,-0.22468112409114838

But we must not forget that this is still 'the election,' the ignorant election of the common-weal which is under criticism, and though this election has been revoked in the play already, and this is a banished man we are trying here, there was a play in progress when this play was played, in which that revocation was yet to come off; and this Poet was anxious that the subject should be considered <NUM> from the most comprehensive grounds, so that _the principle of 'the election_' need never again be called in question, so that the revolution should end in the state, and not in the principle of revolution.

1612,"'Poor, naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,'-- There are no empty phrases in this prayer, the critic of it may perceive: it is a learned prayer; the petitioner knows the meaning of each word in it: the tempest is the book in which he studied it.

Certainly the spirit of Christianity, as it appeared in the life of its Founder, at least, seems to be, by a poetic anachronism incorporated in it. But it is never the custom of this author to leave the diligent student of his performances in any doubt whatever as to his meaning.

1618,"He is bound to show that the true love of the common-weal, that principle which recognises and embraces the weal of others as its own, that principle which enters into and constitutes each man's own noblest life, is a thing of another growth and essence, a thing which needs a different culture from any that the Roman Volumnia could give it, a culture which unalytic, barbaric ages--wanting in all the scientific arts--could not give it.

The end which he has pursued at such a cost is within his reach at last; but he cannot grasp it. The city lies there before him, and his dragon wings encircle it; there is steel enough in the claws and teeth now, but he cannot take it. For there is no law and no justice of the peace, and no general within to put down the conflict of changeful, _warring selfs_, to suppress the mutiny of mutually opposing, mutually _annihilating_ selfish dictates. In vain he seeks to make his will immutable; for the single passion has its hour, this 'would-do' changes.

'For those whose doctrines are already _seated_ in popular opinion, have only to dispute or prove; but those whose doctrines are beyond the popular opinions, have a _double labour_; the one to make themselves conceived, and the other to prove and demonstrate; so that it is of _necessity with them to have recourse to similitudes_ AND TRANSLATIONS _to express themselves_. And, therefore, in the _infancy of learning_, and in rude times, when those conceptions which are now trivial, were then new, _the world was full of parables and similitudes_, for else would men either have passed over _without mark, or else_ REJECTED FOR PARADOXES, that which was offered _before they had understood or judged_. So in divine learning, we see how frequent parables and tropes are, for it _is a rule in the doctrine of delivery, that every science_ which is _not consonant with presuppositions and prejudices_, must pray in aid of _similes_ and _allusions_.'",unknown,JaneAusten,0.6647491455078125,0.6647491455078125,-7.779093265533447

This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been. “My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.

When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or <TIME> was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by <PER>. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms. “My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why <PER> appeared so miserable and <PER> so sad.

1635,"'to which,' continues this political philosopher,--that is, to which preceding anecdote--containing such unflattering intimations with regard to the obstinacy of nature, in the limits she has set to the practical abilities of those _animals_, not enlarging their natural gifts out of respect to the Athenian selection (an anecdote which supplies a rhyme to Hamlet's verse, and to many others from the same source)--'_to which the custom of so many people_, who canonize the <ORG> they have chosen _out of their own body_, and are not content only to honour, but adore them, _comes very near.

It should be stated, however, that in a preceding paragraph, the author has just very pointedly expressed it as his opinion, that men who are supposed, by common consent, to be so far above the rest of mankind in their single virtue and judgment, that they are permitted to govern them at their discretion, should by no means undertake to maintain that view, by exhibiting that supposed kingly and divine faculty in the way of _speech_ or _argument_; thus putting themselves on a level with their subjects, and by meeting them on their own ground, with their own weapons, giving occasion for comparisons, perhaps not altogether favourable to that theory of a superlative and divine difference which the doctrine of a divine right to rule naturally presupposes.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9781016707420349,0.9781016707420349,-0.9569203853607178
1636,"Those forces which enter into all the plot of our human life, unworthy of philosophic note as they had seemed hitherto, those terrific, unmeasured strengths, against which the human kind are continually dashing themselves in their blind experiments,--those engines on which the human heart is racked, 'and stretched out so long,'--those rocky structures on which its choicest treasures are so wildly wrecked, these natural forces,--no matter what artificial combinations of them may have been accomplished,--'the causes _in nature_,' of the phenomena of human life, appeared to this philosopher a very fitting subject for philosophy, and one quite too important in its relation to human well-being and the Arts that promote it, to be left to mere blundering experiment; quite too subtle to be reached by any kind of empirical groping, quite too subtle to be entangled with the conclusions of the _philosophy_ which he found in vogue in his time, whose social efficacies and gifts in exorcisms, he has taken leave to connect in some way, with the appearance of <PER> o' <PER> in his history; a philosophy which had built up its system in defiant scorn of the nature of things; as if 'by reasoning it _thus_ and _thus_,' without any respect to the actual conditions, it could undertake to bridle the might of nature, and put a hook in the nose of her oppositions.

1637,"Once he found a ridge of grass unusually long and green, and heard a whispering, and investigating found a narrow brook which murmured as it flowed. He followed along its bank until he came to the cove it had named, and watched the sparse stream cascade over the granite and fall thinly down its steep wall. The wet rock glistened in the sun, it seemed to the boy as if with tears. He threw himself down beside it and, leaning on his elbow, rested his head on his hand. Through the cut between this island and the next, boats were passing coming in from the foaming waves of the sea to the quiet waters of the sound. Life, beauty, peace. The boy closed his eyes. The longing to portray it all rose in him like an anguish. He felt his old torpidity to be better than this. Why should his new friend stir up a craving for the impossible? She meant to be kind. She seemed really to like him; and she had liked his drawing and had wanted him to do more. She would find that it was impossible, and he hoped that she would make no more effort.

Exhilarated by the thought of being homeward-bound, many of the seamen became joyous, and the discipline of the ship, if anything, became a little relaxed. Many pastimes served to while away the _Dog-Watches_ in particular. These _Dog-Watches_ (embracing <TIME> in the early part of the evening) form the only authorised play-time for the crews of most ships at sea. Among other diversions at present licensed by authority in the <PER>, were those of single-stick, sparring, hammer-and-anvil, and head-bumping. All these were under the direct patronage of the Captain, otherwise—seeing the consequences they sometimes led to—they would undoubtedly have been strictly prohibited. It is a curious coincidence, that when a <ORG> captain does not happen to be an admirer of the _Fistiana_ his crew seldom amuse themselves in that way. _Single-stick_, as every one knows, is a delightful pastime, which consists in <NUM> men standing a few feet apart, and rapping each other over the head with long poles. There is a good deal of fun in it, so long as you are not hit; but a hit—in the judgment of discreet persons—spoils the sport completely. When this pastime is practiced by connoisseurs ashore, they wear heavy, wired helmets, to break the force of the blows. But the only helmets of our tars were those with which nature had furnished them.

But though they <NUM> were as isolated as a new <ORG> in a pretty ornamental <LOC>, the lady did not relax by an inch the rigour of her badinage. “I am locked up in the madhouse,” said <PER>, with a sort of stiff pride, “because I tried to keep my promise to you.” “Quite so,” answered the inexplicable lady, nodding with a perfectly blazing smile, “and I am locked up because it was to me you promised.” “It is outrageous!” cried <PER>; “it is impossible!” “Oh, you can see my certificate if you like,” she replied with some hauteur. MacIan stared at her and then at his boots, and then at the sky and then at her again. He was quite sure now that he himself was not mad, and the fact rather added to his perplexity. Then he drew nearer to her, and said in a dry and dreadful voice: “Oh, don't condescend to play the fool with such a fool as me. Are you really locked up here as a patient--because you helped us to escape?” “Yes,” she said, still smiling, but her steady voice had a shake in it. <PER> flung his big elbow across his forehead and burst into tears. The pure lemon of the sky faded into purer white as the great sunset silently collapsed. The birds settled back into the trees; the moon began to glow with its own light.

1656,"When my pantaloons ripped and tore, as I have said, I did my best to mend and patch them; but not being much of a sempstress, the more I patched the more they parted; because I put my patches on, without heeding the joints of the legs, which only irritated my poor pants the more, and put them out of temper. Nor must I forget my boots, which were almost new when I left home. They had been my <DATE> boots, and fitted me to a charm. I never had had a pair of boots that I liked better; I used to turn my toes out when I walked in them, unless it was <TIME> time, when no one could see me, and I had something else to think of; and I used to keep looking at them during church; so that I lost a good deal of the sermon. In a word, they were a beautiful pair of boots. But all this only unfitted them the more for sea-service; as I soon discovered. They had very high heels, which were all the time tripping me in the rigging, and several times came near pitching me overboard; and the salt water made them shrink in such a manner, that they pinched me terribly about the instep; and I was obliged to gash them cruelly, which went to my very heart. The legs were quite long, coming a good way up toward my knees, and the edges were mounted with <ORG>. The sailors used to call them my _“gaff-topsail-boots.”_ And sometimes they used to call me “Boots,” and sometimes “Buttons,” on account of the ornaments on my pantaloons and shooting-jacket. At last, I took their advice, and _“razeed”_ them, as they phrased it. That is, I amputated the legs, and shaved off the heels to the bare soles; which, however, did not much improve them, for it made my feet feel flat as flounders, and besides, brought me down in the world, and made me slip and slide about the decks, as I used to at home, when I wore straps on the ice. As for my tarpaulin hat, it was a very cheap one; and therefore proved a real sham and shave; it leaked like an old shingle roof; and in a rain storm, kept my hair wet and disagreeable. Besides, from lying down on deck in it, during <TIME> watches, it got bruised and battered, and lost all its beauty; so that it was unprofitable every way.

1659,"I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life. Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even <PER> could not have conceived. I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete! <TIME>, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of <LOC>, its white steeple and clock, which indicated <TIME>.

I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky. I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: Like one who, on a lonely road, Doth walk in fear and dread, And, having once turned round, walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows a frightful fiend <PER> close behind him tread.

1660,"It involved necessarily, indeed, the most searching and relentless criticisms of the existing institutions of that time. That cry of social misery which pervades it, in which the natural, and social, and artificial evils are still discriminated through all the most tragic bursts of passion--in which the true social need, in all its comprehension, is uttered--that wild cry of human anguish, prolonged, and repeated, and reverberated as it is--is all one outcry upon the social wisdom of the Poet's time. It constitutes <NUM> continuous dramatic expression and embodiment of that so deeply-rooted opinion which the New Philosopher is known to have entertained, in regard to the practical knowledge of mankind as he found it; his opinion of the real advances towards the true human ends which had been made in his time; an opinion which he has, indeed, taken occasion to express elsewhere with some distinctness, considering the conditions which hampered the expression of his philosophical conclusions; but it is one which could hardly have been produced from the philosophic chair in his time, or from the bench, or at the council-table, in such terms as we find him launching out into here, without any fear or scruple.

My top-mates thought that this remarkable metamorphose was the effect produced upon a weak, vain character suddenly elevated from the level of a mere seaman to the dignified position of a _petty officer_. But though, in similar cases, I had seen such effects produced upon some of the crew; yet, in the present instance, I knew better than that;—it was solely brought about by his consorting with with those villainous, irritable, ill-tempered cannon; more especially from his being subject to the orders of those deformed blunderbusses, Priming and <PER>.

The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of <LOC>; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white <LOC> which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country.

1680,"A book composed for the express purpose of meeting the difficulty here alluded to, has been already noticed in the preceding pages, on account of its being one of the most striking samples of that peculiar style of _tradition_, which the advancement of <ORG> prescribes, and here is another, in which the same invention and discovery appears to be indicated:--'Why I can teach you'--says a somewhat doubtful claimant to supernatural gifts: 'Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command The devil.' 'And I can teach _thee_, coz, to shame the devil; By telling truth; If thou hast power to raise him, bring him hither, And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence: Oh, while you live, TELL TRUTH.' But _this_ is the style, in which the <NUM> before referred to, falls in with the humour of this Advancer of Learning. 'As to the rest, I have enjoined _myself_ to dare to _say_, all that I dare _to do_, and even _thoughts_ that are not to be published, displease me. The worst of my actions and qualities do not appear to me so foul, as I find it foul and base not to dare to own them. Every one is wary and discreet in _confession_, but men ought to be so in _action_. I wish that this excessive license of mine, may draw men to freedom _above these timorous and mincing pretended virtues, sprung from our imperfections_, and that at the expense of my immoderation, I may reduce them to reason. A man must see and study his vice to correct it, they who conceal it from others, commonly conceal it from themselves and do not think it covered enough, if they themselves see it.... the diseases of the soul, the greater they are, keep themselves the more obscure; the most sick are the least sensible of them: for these reasons they must often be dragged into light, by an unrelenting and pitiless hand; they must be opened and torn from the caverns and secret recesses of the heart.' 'To meet the <LOC>, who condemn our auricular and private confession, I confess myself in public, religiously and purely,--others have published the errors of their _opinions_, I of my _manners_. I am greedy of making myself known, and I care not to how many, provided it be truly; or rather, I hunger for nothing, but I mortally hate to be _mistaken_ by those who happen to come across _my name_.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.984096884727478,0.984096884727478,-0.7349263429641724

1684,"Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish. I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking. My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather <TIME>, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships.

Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends.

The organization of that large, complex, difficult form in nature, in which the many are united in 'the greater congregation'; that more extensive whole, of which the units are each, not simple forms, but the complicated, most highly complex, and not yet subdued complexity, which the individual form of man in itself constitutes; this so difficult result of nature's combinations and her laws of combination, labouring, struggling towards its consummation, but disordered, threatened, convulsed, asking aid of _art_, is the subject; the cure of it, the cure and healthful regimen of it, the problem.

The reading of it is very simple. One has only to observe that the Poet avails himself of the _dialogue_ here, with even more than his usual freedom, for the purpose of disposing of the bolder passages, in the least objectionable manner,--interrupting the statement in critical points, and emphasizing it, by that interruption, to the careful reader 'of the argument,' but to the spectator, or to one who takes it as a _dialogue merely_, neutralizing it by that dramatic opposition.

The local situation of the college, so far secluded from the sight and sound of the busy world, is peculiarly favorable to the moral, if not to the literary, habits of its students; and this advantage probably caused the founders to overlook the inconveniences that were inseparably connected with it.

To a quiet, contemplative character, averse to uproar, undue exercise of his bodily members, and all kind of useless confusion, nothing can be more distressing than a proceeding in all men-of-war called “_general quarters_.” And well may it be so called, since it amounts to a general drawing and quartering of all the parties concerned. As the specific object for which a man-of-war is built and put into commission is to fight and fire off cannon, it is, of course, deemed indispensable that the crew should be duly instructed in the art and mystery involved. Hence these “general quarters,” which is a mustering of all hands to their stations at the guns on the several decks, and a sort of sham-fight with an imaginary foe. The summons is given by the ship’s drummer, who strikes a peculiar beat—short, broken, rolling, shuffling—like the sound made by the march into battle of iron-heeled grenadiers. It is a regular tune, with a fine song composed to it; the words of the chorus, being most artistically arranged, may give some idea of the air: “Hearts of oak are our ships, jolly tars are our men, We always are ready, steady, boys, steady, To fight and to conquer, again and again.” In warm weather this pastime at the guns is exceedingly unpleasant, to say the least, and throws a quiet man into a violent passion and perspiration. For <NUM>, I ever abominated it. I have a heart like <PER>, and upon occasions would fight like <PER>.

1717,"Its foundations are laid,--its perennial source is found, not in the soul of man, not in the constitution of the mind of man only, but in the nature of things, and in the universal laws of being.

They pay no attention to our present method of reasoning about them. There is no objection to syllogisms, as Lord Bacon concedes;--they are very useful in their proper place. The difficulty is, that the subtlety of nature in general, as exhibited in that result which we call fact, far surpasses the subtlety of nature, when developed within that limited sphere, which the mind of man makes; and nature is much more than a match for him, when he throws himself upon his own internal gifts of ratiocination, and undertakes to dictate to the universe. The difficulty is just this;--here we have it in a nut-shell, as we are apt to get it in Lord Bacon's aphorisms. 'The syllogism consists of propositions; these of words. Words are the signs of notions: notions represent things:' --'if _our notions_ are _fantastical_, the whole structure falls to the ground. But they are, for the most part, _improperly abstracted_, and deduced from things,' and that is the difficulty which this new method of learning, propounded in connection with this so radical criticism of the old one, undertakes to remedy. For there are just _<NUM>_ methods of learning, as he goes on to tell us, with increasing, but cautious, amplifications. The false method lays down from the very outset some abstract and _useless_ generalities,--_the other_, gradually rises to those principles which are really the most common in nature.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9753164649009705,0.9753164649009705,-0.8566750288009644

The causes which lie next to our experience--the causes, which are variable and many, do not satisfy him. He gains that platform, and looks about him. He finds that even a diligent inquiry and observation _there_ would result in many new inventions beneficial to men; but the knowledge of these causes 'takes men in narrow and restrained paths'; he wants for the founding of his rule of art the cause which, under all conditions, secures the result, which gives the widest possible command of means. He refuses to accept of the physical causes as the bourne of his philosophy, in theory or practice. He looks with a great human scorn on all the possible arts and solutions which lie on _that_ platform, when the proposal is to stop his philosophy of speculation and practice _there_. It is not for the scientific arts, which that field of observation yields, that he begs leave to revive and _re-integrate_ the misapplied and abused name of _natural magic_, which, in the true sense, is but natural wisdom, or 'PRUDENCE.' He can hardly stop to indicate the results which the culture of that field _does_ yield for the relief of the human estate. His eye is uplifted to that new platform of a solid metaphysics, an historical metaphysics, which the inductive method builds. His eye is intent always on that higher stage of knowledge where that which is common to the sciences is found. He takes the other in passing only. Beginning with the basis of a new observation and history of nature, he will found a new metaphysics--an _objective_ metaphysics--the metaphysics of induction.

1726,"She looked off a moment in thought, then rose, went into the house and upstairs to the <PER> room. The door was ajar. She could hear the boy sobbing. Entering, she saw him stretched on his cot, and she approached, drawing a chair beside it.

No human being can have as much power over us as God has. He isn't going to forget His own children whom He has created. So the more you think about Him, knowing that He is all-powerful and all-loving, the sooner you will feel His help coming to you. We don't know just how or when, but be sure it will come if you won't listen to discouragement. Discouragement is like a cloud that hides the sun, and God is the sun of the whole universe. You are trying to hide away from Him when you weep and let thoughts of grief and despair come in."" Her voice carried through the nervous, dry sobs, and they lessened as she talked.

1727,"Nor is it wonder if sometimes a _piece of history_ or other things are introduced by way of ornament, or if _the times_ of the action are confounded,' [the very likeliest thing in the world to happen; things are often 'forced in _time_' as he has given us to understand in complimenting a king's book where the person was absent but not the occasion], 'or if part of <NUM> fable be tacked to another, for all this must necessarily happen, as the fables were the invention of men who lived in _different ages_, and had _different views_, some of them being _ancient_, others more _modern_, some having an eye to _natural philosophy_, _others_ to _morality_ and _civil policy_.' This appears to be just the kind of criticism we happen to be in need of in conducting our present inquiry, and the passage which follows is not less to the purpose.

And, apparently, the argument he proceeds to, is worth some trouble, since he takes pains to bring it out so cautiously, under so many different heads, with such iteration and fulness, taking care to insert it so many times in his work on <ORG>, and here producing it again in his Introduction to the Wisdom of the <ORG>, accompanied with a distinct assurance that it is _not_ the wisdom of the _ancients_ he is concerning himself about, and _their_ necessities and helps and instruments; though if any <NUM> persists in thinking that it _is_, he is not disposed to disturb him in the gravity of that judgment. He honestly thinks that they had indeed such intentions as those that he describes; but that is a question for the curious, and he has other work on hand; he happens to be one, whose views of learning and its uses, do not keep him long on questions of mere curiosity.

After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.

What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished.

The <NUM> time that I passed through this long lane of pauperism, it seemed hard to believe that such an array of misery could be furnished by any town in the world. Every variety of want and suffering here met the eye, and every vice showed here its victims. Nor were the marvelous and almost incredible shifts and stratagems of the professional beggars, wanting to finish this picture of all that is dishonorable to civilization and humanity. Old women, rather mummies, drying up with slow starving and age; young girls, incurably sick, who ought to have been in the hospital; sturdy men, with the gallows in their eyes, and a whining lie in their mouths; young boys, hollow-eyed and decrepit; and puny mothers, holding up puny babes in the glare of the sun, formed the main features of the scene.

1736,"They are _abstract_ terms, and, of course, nobody need see that they are a different kind of abstraction from the old ones, that the grappling-hook on all particulars has been abstracted in them.

This looks a little like growing towards a point. We are apt to consider these motions in certain _specific_ forms, as they appear in those extensive wholes and larger congregations, which it is not necessary to name more particularly in this connection, though they are terms of a 'suggestive' character, to borrow the author's own expression, and belong properly to subjects which this author has just included in his system. But this is none other than his own philosophy which he seems to be criticising, and rating, and rejecting here so scornfully; but if we go on a little further, we shall find what the criticism amounts to, and that it is only the limitation of it to _the general statement_--that it is _the abstract_ form of it, which he complains of. He wishes to direct our attention to the fact, that he does not consider it good for anything in that general form in which he has put it in his Book of Learning. This is the deficiency which he is always pointing out in that work, because this is the deficiency which it has been his chief labour to supply. Till that defect, that grand defect which his philosophy exhibits, as it stands in his books of abstract science, is supplied--that defect to which, even in these works themselves, he is always directing our attention--he cannot, without self-contradiction, propound his philosophy to the world as a practical one, good for human relief. In order that it should accomplish the ends to which it is addressed, it is not enough, he tells us in so many words, to exhibit it in the abstract, in general terms, for these are but 'the husks and shells of sciences.' It must be brought down and applied to those artistic reformations which afflicted, oppressed human nature demands--to those artistic constructions to which human nature spontaneously, instinctively tends, and empirically struggles to achieve.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.957156777381897,0.957156777381897,-1.8093996047973633
1738,"An English writer (in a 'Letter to the Earl of Ellesmere,' published within <DATE>) has thought it not inconsistent with the fair-play, on which his country prides itself, to take to himself this lady's theory, and favour the public with it as his own original conception, without allusion to the author's prior claim.

It had been the author's original purpose to publish it in <LOC>; for she wished her own country to have the glory of solving the enigma of those mighty dramas, and thus adding a new and higher value to the loftiest productions of the English mind.

1740,"He will show how those dragon teeth and claws, that were just getting the steel into them, which would have armed that single will against the whole, and its _weal_, crumble for the lack of it; he will show us the new-fledged wings, with all their fresh gauds, collapsing and dissolving with that popular withdrawal. He will continue the process, till there is nothing left of all that gorgeous state pageant, which came in with the flourish of trumpets and the voice of the herald long and loud, and the echoing thunder of the commons, but a poor grub of a man, in his native conditions, a private citizen, denied even the common privilege of citizenship,--with only his wife and his mother and a friend or <NUM>, to cling to him,--turned out of the city gates, to seek his fortune. But that is the moment in which the Poet ventures to bring out a little more fully, in the form of positive statement, that latent affirmation, that definition of the true nobility which underlies all the play and glistens through it in many a fine, but hitherto, unnoticed point; that affirmation which all these negatives conclude in, that latent idea of the true personal greatness and its essential relation to the common-weal and the state, which is the predominant idea of the play, which shapes all the criticism and points all the satire of it. It is there that the true hero speaks out for a moment from the lips of that old military heroism, of a greatness which does not cease when the wings of state drop off from it, of an honour that takes no stain though all the human voices join to sully it,--the dignity that rises and soars and gains the point of immutability, when all the world would have it under foot. But in that nobility men need training,--_scientific training_. The instinctive, unartistic human growth, or the empirical unscientific arts of culture, give but a vulgar counterfeit of it, or at best a poor, sickly, distorted, convulsive, unsatisfactory type of it, for 'being gentle, wounded,'--(and it is gentility and nobility and the true aristocracy that we speak of here,)--'craves a NOBLE CUNNING;' so the old military chieftain tells us. It is a _cunning_ which his author does not put _him_ upon practising personally. Practically he represents another school of heroes. It is the _word_ of that higher heroism in which he was himself wanting, it is the criticism on his own part, it is the affirmation which all this grand historic negative is always pointing to, which the author borrows his lips to utter.",unknown,OscarWilde,0.9626222848892212,0.9626222848892212,-2.917341470718384

The name was a long one, but so familiar that she recognized it at once. “<LOC>.” She lifted her eyes to her grandfather. “It's the same as ours.” “There isn't another <LOC> in Bel-Air,” returned the broker. “The fairies dropped this for you, I guess, <PER>.

'Nothing presses so hard upon a state as innovation; change only gives form to injustice and tyranny. WHEN ANY PIECE IS OUT OF ORDER IT MAY BE PROPPED, one may prevent and take care that the _decay and corruption_ NATURAL TO ALL THINGS, do not carry us too far from _our beginnings and principles_; but to undertake to found so great a mass anew, and to change the foundations of so vast a building, is for them to do who to _make clean, efface_, who would reform particular defects by a universal confusion, and cure diseases by _death_.' Surely, one may read in good <LOC> English passages which savor somewhat of this policy. One would say that the principle was in fact identical, as, for instance, in this case.

It was enough for him, at such a time, to be allowed to put down the fact that the art of it was properly scientific, and included in his plan, and to indicate the kind of science that is wanting to it; for the rest, he gives us to understand that he has himself fallen on such felicitous times, and finds that affair in the hands of a person so extremely learned in it, that there is really nothing to be said.

1761,"That's more than we know._ _<PER>_. Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough, if we know we are the king's subjects; if his cause be wrong, our obedience to the _king_ wipes the crime of it out of us. _Will_.

1767,"It is not merely in the direct discourse on questions of physical science, as in the physician's report of the resources of his art, or in <PER>'s invocation to 'all the _blessed secrets_--the _unpublished_ virtues of the earth,' that the track of the new physiological science, which this work embodies, may be seen. It runs through it all; it betrays itself at every turn. But the subtle and occult relations of the moral and physical are noted here, as we do not find them noted elsewhere, in less practical theories of nature. That there is something in the design of this play which requires an elaborate and systematic exhibition of the '_special_' human relationships, natural and artificial, political, social, and domestic, almost any reading of it would show. And that this design involves, also, a systematic exhibition of the social _consequences_ arising from the violation of the natural laws or duties of these relationships, and that this violation is everywhere systematically aggravated,--carried to its last conceivable extreme, so that all the play is filled with the uproar of <NUM> continued outrage on _humanity_; this is not less evident for the Poet is not content with the material which his chronicle offered him, already invented to his hands for this purpose, but he has deliberately tacked to it, and intricately connected with it throughout, another plot, bearing on the surface of it, and in the most prominent statements, the author's intention in this respect; which tends not only in the most unequivocal manner to repeat and corroborate the impressions which the story of <ORG> produces, but to widen the dramatic exhibition, so as to make it capable of conveying the whole breadth of the philosophic conception. For it is the scientific doctrine of MAN that is taught here; and that is, that man must be _human_ in _all_ his relations, or '_cease to be_.' It is the violation of the ESSENTIAL humanity. It is a DEGENERACY which is exhibited here, and the 'SEQUENT EFFECTS' which belong naturally to the violation of a law that has the force of the universe to sustain it.

1785,"I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow. “You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?” “How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.

1788,"For this is the philosopher who puts it down as a primary Article of Science, that governments should be based on a scientific acquaintance with 'the _natures, dispositions, necessities_ and _discontents_ of _the people_'; and though in his book of the Advancement of Learning, he suggests that these points '_ought to be_,' considering the means of ascertaining them at the disposal of the government, 'considering the variety of its intelligences, the wisdom of its observations, and the height of the station where it keeps sentinel, _transparent as crystal,'--here_ he puts the case of a government that had not availed itself of those extraordinary means of ascertaining the truth at a distance, and was therefore in the way of discovering much that was new, in the course of an accidental personal descent into the lower and more inaccessible regions of the _Common_ Weal it had ordered.

Because the great lesson of state has entered his soul: with the sharpness of its illustration it has _pierced_ him: his spirit is dilated, and moved and kindling with its grandeur: he is thinking of 'the Many,' he has forgotten 'the One,'--the many, all whose senses have like conditions, whose affections stoop with the like wing. He will not enter, because he thinks it unregal, inhuman, mean, selfish to engross the luxury of the hovel's shelter, and the warmth of the 'precious' straw, while he knows that he has subjects still abroad with senses like his own, capable of the like misery, still exposed to its merciless cruelties.

1789,"He's the one to go to in trouble.” “But you're going to that <LOC> woman,” objected <PER>. “Yes, because she'll go to God for me. I'm being held down by something that pretends to have power, and though I know it's an old cheat, I haven't understanding enough to get rid of it as quickly as she will. You see, I wouldn't have been taken sick if I hadn't believed in a lie instead of denying it. We have to watch our thoughts every minute, and I tell you, <PER>, sometimes it seems real hard work.” “Should say so,” returned '<PER>. “The less you think the better, I should suppose, if that's the case. I've got to be going now.” “And you'll send the telegram _surely_, and you won't speak of it to any one?” “Mum's the word, and I'll send it if it's the last act; but don't put all your eggs in <NUM> basket, little kid.

1791,"The most interesting narrative of the evening was <PER>. His self possession, fine presence, and good voice made more effective the marvelous story of his mother's resurrection to strength. He told it with dignity and directness, and Mr. <PER> was impressed. “What's my rheumatism to that, eh, <PER>?” he whispered, as <PER> sat down. “Just nothing, grandpa,” replied the child. “You think the Creator'd consider me worth attending to, eh?” “God doesn't know you have the rheumatism,” exclaimed <ORG> with soft scorn. “Doesn't? Well! I've always supposed He thought I needed reminding on account of a number of things, and so touched me up with that. I didn't blame Him much. “If He knew it, it would be real, and then it couldn't be changed,” returned <ORG> earnestly in the ear he bent to her. The broker sat up and looked down on her large hat and short legs. “Whew, but I'm a back number!” he mused. The next testimonial made <ORG>'s eyes brighten. It was given by a man who told a story of hopeless intemperance and his family's want. The unaffected humility and gratitude that sounded in his voice as he described the changed conditions which followed his cure caused the roses to deepen in <ORG>'s cheeks. She wondered where <PER> was sitting. Altogether she was happy over the meeting, and her grandfather's attitude was as kindly as could have been expected. <PER> came into her mother's room that night, beaming. “I wish you had come with us,” she said. “It was wonderful.” Mrs. <PER> turned to her with a lofty air. “I have too much loyalty to friendship to be seen in such a place,” she returned. “<PER> said he wouldn't ask you to come down to bid him good-by, because he expects to come out to spend <DATE> for a while.” Mrs. <PER> looked at her daughter. All the girl's face had lacked of vivacity and happy expression it wore now, making her radiant. “You could never guess the news I have for you, mother.” Mrs. <PER>'s lips tightened. “<PER>, if you will not marry the fine man who had my entire approval, it will be outrageous for you to marry an ineligible, a young fellow whose goods are all in the show window, who has not proved himself in any way.

1795,"My mother, for instance.” “Yes; but then you'd find out how to help her.” <PER> glanced at the child curiously. She thought it would be interesting to peep into <ORG>'s mind and see her estimate of <PER>. “My mother has a great deal to trouble her,” she said loyally. “Yes, I know she thinks she has,” returned the child. Again her response surprised her companion. “I'll take you as you are, <PER>,” she said. “I'm glad you're not grown up. You're fresher from the workshop.” CHAPTER XXI AN EFFORT FOR TRUTH When <PER> spoke in the ravine of talking with her grandfather, it was because for <DATE> she had been trying to make up her mind to an interview with him. <DATE> she would have felt this to be impossible; but subtle changes had been going on in herself, and, she thought, in him. If her mother would undertake the interview now and take that stand with Mr. <PER> which <PER> felt that self-respect demanded, the girl would gladly escape it; but there was no prospect of such a thing. Mrs. <PER> was only too glad to benefit by her father-in-law's modified mood, to glide along the surface of things and wait--<PER> knew it, knew it every day, in moments when her cheeks flushed hot--for Dr. <PER> to throw the handkerchief. The girl wished to talk with Mr. <PER> without her mother's knowledge, and the prospect was a dreaded ordeal. She felt that they had won his contempt, and she feared the loss of her own self-control when she should come to touch upon the sore spots. “What would you do, <PER>,” she asked <TIME>, after they had read the lesson; “what would you do if you were afraid of somebody?” “I wouldn't be,” returned the child quickly. “Well, I am. Now what am I going to do about it?” <PER>, who always gave unwinking attention to the lesson, was in <LOC>'s lap, and the child twisted out the in-turning <LOC> foot as she spoke. “Why, I'd know that one thought of God couldn't be afraid of another,” she replied in the conclusive tone to which <PER> could never grow accustomed. “Oh, <PER>, child,” the girl said impatiently, “we'd be sorry to think most of the people we know are thoughts of God.” “That's because you get the error man mixed up with the real one.",unknown,VirginiaWoolf,0.9853852391242981,0.9853852391242981,-0.24269583821296692
1796,"Getting dripping to his feet, with the water up to his knees, the worshipper of force and victory waded disconsolately to the other side and drew himself on to the bank. And <PER> sat down on the grass and went off into reverberations of laughter. A <NUM> afterwards the most extraordinary grimaces were seen to distort the stiff face of <ORG>, and unholy sounds came from within. He had never practised laughing, and it hurt him very much. VII. THE VILLAGE OF GRASSLEY-IN-THE-HOLE At <NUM>, under a strong blue sky, <PER> got up out of the grass and fern in which he had been lying, and his still intermittent laughter ended in a kind of yawn. “I'm hungry,” he said shortly. “Are you?” “I have not noticed,” answered <ORG>. “What are you going to do?” “There's a village down the road, past the pool,” answered <PER>. “I can see it from here. I can see the whitewashed walls of some cottages and a kind of corner of the church. How jolly it all looks. It looks so--I don't know what the word is--so sensible. Don't fancy I'm under any illusions about Arcadian virtue and the innocent villagers. Men make beasts of themselves there with drink, but they don't deliberately make devils of themselves with mere talking. They kill wild animals in the wild woods, but they don't kill cats to the God of Victory. They don't----” He broke off and suddenly spat on the ground. “Excuse me,” he said; “it was ceremonial. One has to get the taste out of one's mouth.” “The taste of what?” asked <ORG>. “I don't know the exact name for it,” replied <PER>. “Perhaps it is <LOC>, or it may be <ORG>.” There was a long pause, and <ORG> also lifted his large limbs off the ground--his eyes particularly dreamy. “I know what you mean, <PER>,” he said, “but... I always thought you people agreed with all that.” “With all that about doing as one likes, and the individual, and Nature loving the strongest, and all the things which that cockroach talked about.” <PER>'s big blue-grey eyes stood open with a grave astonishment. “Do you really mean to say, <ORG>,” he said, “that you fancied that we, the Free-thinkers, that <LOC>, or <LOC>, or <ORG>, believe all that dirty, immoral mysticism about Nature?",Chesterton,VirginiaWoolf,0.9221275448799133,0.9221275448799133,-2.5744564533233643

It is a parable of you and all your rationalists. You begin by breaking up the <ORG>; but you end by breaking up the habitable world. We leave you saying that nobody ought to join the <ORG> against his will. When we meet you again you are saying that no one has any will to join it with.

You are mad on the cross. Let it save you.” And with a herculean energy he forced the monk backwards out of the reeling car on to the upper part of the stone ball. <PER>, with as abrupt an agility, caught <NUM> of the beams of the cross and saved himself from falling. At the same instant <PER> drove down a lever and the ship shot up with him in it alone. “Ha! ha!” he yelled, “what sort of a support do you find it, old fellow?” “For practical purposes of support,” replied <PER>, “it is at any rate a great deal better than the ball. May I ask if you are going to leave me here?” “Yes, yes. I mount! I mount!” cried the professor in ungovernable excitement. “_<PER> peto_. My path is upward.” “How often have you told me, Professor, that there is really no up or down in space?” said the monk. “I shall mount up as much as you will.” “Indeed,” said <PER>, leering over the side of the flying ship. “May I ask what you are going to do?” The monk pointed downward at Ludgate Hill. “I am going,” he said, “to climb up into a star.” Those who look at the matter most superficially regard paradox as something which belongs to jesting and light journalism.",Chesterton,OscarWilde,0.7607629299163818,0.7607629299163818,-5.623528003692627
1799,"That the suppressed <ORG> and Innovators were men so far in advance of their time, that they were compelled to have recourse to literature for the purpose of instituting a gradual encroachment on popular opinions, a gradual encroachment on the prejudices, the ignorance, the stupidity of the oppressed and suffering masses of the human kind, and for the purpose of making over the practical development of the higher parts of their science, to ages in which the advancements they instituted had brought the common mind within hearing of these higher truths; that these were men whose aims were so opposed to the power that was still predominant then,--though the 'wrestling' that would shake that predominance, was already on foot,--that it became necessary for them to conceal their lives as well as their works,--to veil the true worth and nobility of them, to suffer those ends which they sought as means, means which they subordinated to the noblest uses, to be regarded in their own age as their _ends_; that they were compelled to play this great game in secret, in their own time, referring themselves to posthumous effects for the explanation of their designs; postponing their honour to ages able to discover their worth; this is the proposition which is derived here from the works in which the tradition of this learning is conveyed to us.

1806,"'Without _good nature_,' he says elsewhere, using the term _good_ in its scientific sense, '_men_ are only a NOBLER kind of VERMIN'; and he makes a most unsparing application of this principle in his criticisms. Many a splendid historical figure is made to show its teeth, and rat-like mien and propensities, through all the splendour of its disguises, merely by the application of his simple philosophical tests. For the question, as he puts it, is the question between animal instinct, between mere appetite, and reason; and the question incidentally arises in the course of the exhibition, whether the common-weal, when it comes to anything like common-sense, is going to stand being gnawed in this way, for the benefit of any individual, or clique, or party. For the ground on which the classes or estates, and their respective claims to the government, are tried here, is the ground of the _common_-weal; and the question as to the fitness of any existing class in the state for an exclusive, unlimited control of the welfare of the whole, is more than suggested.

It is a question which this author handles with a thorough impartiality, in all his political treatises, let them come in what name and form they will, with more or less clearness, indeed, as the circumstances seem to dictate. But _nowhere_ is the whole history of the military government, collected from the obscurity of the past, and brought out with such inflexible design--with such vividness and strength of historic exhibition, as it is _here_.

1813,"He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. <NUM> man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!” Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure. Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my <DATE>. The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9834850430488586,0.9834850430488586,-2.2562012672424316
1815,"The paradoxical effort was paradoxically successful, and, as publishers’ lists aver to <DATE>, <PER>’s monster has turned out to be the hardest-lived specimen of the ‘raw-head-and-bloody-bones’ school of romantic tales. So much, no doubt, to the credit of <PER>. But more creditable, surely, is the fact that she was not tempted, as ‘Monk’ Lewis had been, to persevere in those lugubrious themes. Although her publishers—_et pour cause_—insisted on styling her ‘the author of <PER>’, an entirely different vein appears in her later productions. Indeed, a quiet reserve of tone, a slow, sober, and sedate bearing, are henceforth characteristic of all her literary attitudes. It is almost a case of running from one to the other extreme. The force of style which even adverse critics acknowledged in _<PER>_ was sometimes perilously akin to the most disputable kinds of romantic rant. But in the historical or society novels which followed, in the contributions which graced the ‘Keepsakes’ of the thirties, and even—alas—in the various prefaces and commentaries which accompanied the publication of so many poems of <PER>, his wife succumbed to an increasing habit of almost Victorian reticence and dignity. And those later novels and tales, though they sold well in <DATE> and were kindly reviewed, can hardly boast of any reputation now. Most of them are pervaded by a brooding spirit of melancholy of the ‘moping’ rather than the ‘musical’ sort, and consequently rather ineffective as an artistic motive. Students of <PER> occasionally scan those pages with a view to pick some obscure ‘hints and indirections’, some veiled reminiscences, in the stories of the adventures and misfortunes of _The Last Man_ or _Lodore_. And the books may be good biography at times—they are never life. Altogether there is a curious contrast between the <NUM> aspects, hitherto revealed, of <PER> literary activities. It is as if the pulse which had been beating so wildly, so frantically, in _<PER>_ (<DATE>), had lapsed, with _Valperga_ (1823) and the rest, into an increasingly sluggish flow. The following pages may be held to bridge the gap between those <NUM> extremes in a felicitous way. A more purely artistic mood, instinct with the serene joy and clear warmth of Italian skies, combining a good deal of youthful buoyancy with a sort of quiet and unpretending philosophy, is here represented. And it is submitted that the little classical fancies which Mrs. <PER> never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of consideration as her more ambitious prose works.

1819,"He paid her no voluntary visit, and even declined an invitation to tea, with which Mrs. <PER>, after extensive preparations, had favored him. He seemed to have resumed all the habits of seclusion by which he was distinguished previous to his acquaintance with <PER>, except that he still took his sunset walk on the banks of the stream. On <NUM> of these occasions, he stayed his footsteps by the old leafless oak which had witnessed <PER>'s <NUM> meeting with the angler. Here he mused upon the circumstances that had resulted from that event, and upon the rights and privileges (for he was well aware of them all) which those circumstances had given him. Perhaps the loveliness of the scene and the recollections connected with it, perhaps the warm and mellow sunset, perhaps a temporary weakness in himself, had softened his feelings, and shaken the firmness of his resolution, to leave <PER> to be happy with his rival. His strong affections rose up against his reason, whispering that bliss--on earth and in heaven, through time and eternity--might yet be his lot with her. It is impossible to conceive of the flood of momentary joy which the bare admission of such a possibility sent through his frame; and, just when the tide was highest in his heart, a soft little hand was laid upon his own, and, starting, he beheld <PER> at his side. Her illness, since the commencement of which <PER> had not seen her, had wrought a considerable, but not a disadvantageous, change in her appearance. She was paler and thinner; her countenance was more intellectual, more spiritual; and a spirit did the student almost deem her, appearing so suddenly in that solitude. There was a quick vibration of the delicate blood in her cheek, yet never brightening to the glow of perfect health; a tear was glittering on each of her long, dark eyelashes; and there was a gentle tremor through all her frame, which compelled her, for a little space, to support herself against the oak. <PER>'s <NUM> impulse was to address her in words of rapturous delight; but he checked himself, and attempted--vainly indeed--to clothe his voice in tones of calm courtesy. His remark merely expressed pleasure at her restoration to health; and <PER>'s low and indistinct reply had as little relation to the feelings that agitated her. ""Yet I fear,"" continued <PER>, recovering a degree of composure, and desirous of assigning a motive (which he felt was not the true one) for <PER>'s agitation,--""I fear that your walk has extended too far for your strength.""",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9898843765258789,0.9898843765258789,-0.9883345365524292

1821,"No; these are the Poet's words, rather--'such eyes.' _Such_ eyes. It was the Poet who could look through the barriers--those hitherto impervious barriers of an _enemy's town_, and see in it, at that moment, eyes as beautiful--eyes that had been 'dove's eyes,' too, to those who had loved them, wet with other tears,--mothers that loved _their_ sons, and 'lacked them'; it was the Poet to whose _human_ sense those hard hostile walls dissolved and cleared away, till he could see the Volscian wives clasping _their_ loves, as they 'came coffined home'; it was the Poet who dared to stain the joy and triumph of that fond meeting, the glory and pride of that triumphal entry, with those _human_ thoughts; it was he who heard above the roll of the drum, and the swell of the clarions and trumpets, and the shout of the rejoicing multitude above the herald's voice--the groans of mortal anguish in the field, the cries of human sorrow in the city, the shrieks of mothers that lacked sons, the greetings of wives whose loves '_came coffined home_.' And he does not mind aggravating the intense selfishness, and narrowness, and stolidity of these private passions and affections of the individual to a truly unnatural and diabolical intensity, by charging on poor <ORG> and <PER> his own reminiscences; as if they could have dared to heighten their joy at that moment by counting its cost--as if they could have looked in the face--as if they could have comprehended, in its actual dimensions, the theme of their vulgar, _narrow_, unlearned exultation. But this is a trick this author is much given to, we shall find, when we come to study him carefully. He is not scrupulous on such points. He has a tolerable sense of the fitness of things, too. His dramatic conscience is as nice as another man's; but he is always ready to sin against it, when he sees reason.

And besides, in that broad, many-sided view of the subject which the author's evolution of it from the root involves,--in that pursuit of tyranny in essence through all its disguises,--other exhibitions of it were involved, which might seem, to the careless eye, purposely designed to counteract the effect of the views above quoted.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9817700982093811,0.9817700982093811,-0.5122707486152649

I was in haste and on an important errand, but I couldn't take my train and leave him there. So I went and sat down beside him and asked him where he was going. He said, to the <LOC> ferry, but he was thick and helpless. I called a little colored boy carrying a large milliner's box, and I asked him if his errand needed to be done immediately. He was pretty doubtful, but he finally said no. So I told him I would check his box and leave a dollar with it for him when he returned, if he would take this young man straight to the <LOC> ferry and see that he did not go in anywhere on the way. He said he would do so, and I gave him his check and car fare and <NUM> for telephoning, and asked him to call me up that evening. I wrote my telephone number and left it with the box. He promised, and my train came along and I had to leave them. <TIME>, the telephone rang. It was my messenger. He said that when he got the young man downstairs to go to the train for the ferry, his charge became violently sick. After that, he came to himself and gave a different direction to the boy. The address of an office building. He was pale and shaky. So the boy stayed with him. They went up in an elevator and into an office where the young man said that he had brought the money.

1837,"It is, however, certain that the work of her house was done somehow, and it is even more rapidly ascertainable that nobody else did it. The logician is, therefore, driven back upon the assumption that she did it; and that lends a sort of mysterious interest to her personality at the beginning. She had very broad, low, and level brows, which seemed even lower because her warm yellow hair clustered down to her eyebrows; and she had a face just plump enough not to look as powerful as it was. Anything that was heavy in all this was abruptly lightened by <NUM> large, light <LOC>-blue eyes, lightened all of a sudden as if it had been lifted into the air by <NUM> big blue butterflies. The rest of her was less than middle-sized, and was of a casual and comfortable sort; and she had this difference from such girls as the girl in the motor-car, that one did not incline to take in her figure at all, but only her broad and leonine and innocent head. Both the father and the daughter were of the sort that would normally have avoided all observation; that is, all observation in that extraordinary modern world which calls out everything except strength. Both of them had strength below the surface; they were like quiet peasants owning enormous and unquarried mines. The father with his square face and grey side whiskers, the daughter with her square face and golden fringe of hair, were both stronger than they know; stronger than anyone knew. The father believed in civilization, in the storied tower we have erected to affront nature; that is, the father believed in Man. The daughter believed in God; and was even stronger. They neither of them believed in themselves; for that is a decadent weakness. The daughter was called a devotee. She left upon ordinary people the impression--the somewhat irritating impression--produced by such a person; it can only be described as the sense of strong water being perpetually poured into some abyss. She did her housework easily; she achieved her social relations sweetly; she was never neglectful and never unkind. This accounted for all that was soft in her, but not for all that was hard. She trod firmly as if going somewhere; she flung her face back as if defying something; she hardly spoke a cross word, yet there was often battle in her eyes.

1844,"I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and _wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had <NUM>, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or _Agatha,_ and the youth _<PER>, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good, dearest, unhappy._ “I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. <PER> listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with <PER>. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends.

1852,"The modicum constituting an ordinary _“chaw,”_ was made to last a whole day; and at <TIME>, permission being had from the cook, this self-same _“chaw”_ was placed in the oven of the stove, and there dried; so as to do duty in a pipe. In the end not a plug was to be had; and deprived of a solace and a stimulus, on which sailors so much rely while at sea, the crew became absent, moody, and sadly tormented with the hypos. They were something like opium-smokers, suddenly cut off from their drug. They would sit on their chests, forlorn and moping; with a steadfast sadness, eying the forecastle lamp, at which they had lighted so many a pleasant pipe. With touching eloquence they recalled those happier evenings—the time of smoke and vapor; when, after a whole day’s delectable _“chawing,”_ they beguiled themselves with their genial, and most companionable puffs. <TIME>, when they seemed more than usually cast down and disconsolate, <PER>, the Irish cockney, started up suddenly with an idea in his head—“Boys, let’s search under the bunks!” Bless you, <PER>! what a happy conceit! Forthwith, the chests were dragged out; the dark places explored; and <NUM> sticks of _nail-rod_ tobacco, and several old _“chaws,”_ thrown aside by sailors on some previous voyage, were their cheering reward. They were impartially divided by <PER>, who, upon this occasion, acquitted himself to the satisfaction of all. Their mode of dividing this tobacco was the rather curious one generally adopted by sailors, when the highest possible degree of impartiality is desirable. I will describe it, recommending its earnest consideration to all heirs, who may hereafter divide an inheritance; for if they adopted this nautical method, that universally slanderous aphorism of <PER> would be forever rendered nugatory—“Expect _not to understand any man till you have divided with him an inheritance.”_ The _nail-rods_ they cut as evenly as possible into as many parts as there were men to be supplied; and this operation having been performed in the presence of all, <PER>, placing the tobacco before him, his face to the wall, and back to the company, struck <NUM> of the bits of weed with his knife, crying out, “Whose is this?” Whereupon a respondent, previously pitched upon, replied, at a venture, from the opposite corner of the forecastle, “Blunt’s;” and to <PER> it went; and so on, in like manner, till all were served.",HermanMelville,EdgarAllanPoe,0.6654162406921387,0.6654162406921387,-4.346683025360107

1862,"But we may press this thing <DATE> further back, for it is a matter of historical doubt whether, in <PER>’s time, <ORG>’s great admiral, such a thing as flogging was known at the gangways of his victorious fleets.

But if of <NUM> famous English Admirals one has abhorred flogging, another almost governed his ships without it, and to the <NUM> it may be supposed to have been unknown, while an American Commander has, within <DATE>, been enabled to sustain the good discipline of an entire squadron in time of war without having an instrument of scourging on board, what inevitable inferences must be drawn, and how disastrous to the mental character of all advocates of <ORG> flogging, who may happen to be navy officers themselves. It cannot have escaped the discernment of any observer of mankind, that, in the presence of its conventional inferiors, conscious imbecility in power often seeks to carry off that imbecility by assumptions of lordly severity. The amount of flogging on board an American man-of-war is, in many cases, in exact proportion to the professional and intellectual incapacity of her officers to command. Thus, in these cases, the law that authorises flogging does but put a scourge into the hand of a fool. In most calamitous instances this has been shown. It is a matter of record, that some English ships of war have fallen a prey to the enemy through the insubordination of the crew, induced by the witless cruelty of their officers; officers so armed by the law that they could inflict that cruelty without restraint. Nor have there been wanting instances where the seamen have ran away with their ships, as in the case of the <PER> and <PER>, and forever rid themselves of the outrageous inflictions of their officers by sacrificing their lives to their fury. Events like these aroused the attention of the British public at the time. But it was a tender theme, the public agitation of which the government was anxious to suppress. Nevertheless, whenever the thing was privately discussed, these terrific mutinies, together with the then prevailing insubordination of the men in the navy, were almost universally attributed to the exasperating system of flogging. And the necessity for flogging was generally believed to be directly referable to the impressment of such crowds of dissatisfied men.",HermanMelville,EdgarAllanPoe,0.583408534526825,0.583408534526825,-4.463687896728516

It is the shutting up of the old books, and the opening of the new ones, which is the business here.

An ignorant man is in awe of books, on account of his ignorance. He thinks there are all sorts of things in them. He is very diffident when it comes to any question in regard to them.

1869,"And we find that the points he resumes to speak of here, are, indeed, points of primary consequence; social forces that do indeed need a scientific control, effects reported, and precepts concluded. Custom and Habit, Books and Studies, and then a kind of culture, which he says, 'seemeth to be more accurate and elaborate than the rest,' which we find, upon examination, to be a strictly religious culture, and lastly the method to which he gives the preference, as the most compendious and summary in its formative or reforming influence, 'the _electing_ and propounding unto a man's self _good and virtuous ends of his life_, such as may be in a _reasonable sort within his compass to attain_.' He says enough under these heads to show the difficulty of writing on a subject where the science has been reported wanting, while the '<ORG> is prescribed. He lays much stress on CUSTOM and HABIT, and gives some few precepts for its management, 'made out of the pith and heart of sciences,' but he speaks briefly, and chiefly for the purpose of indicating the value he attaches to this point, for he concludes his precepts and observations on it, thus: 'Many other axioms there are, touching the managing of exercise and custom, which being _so conducted_,-- scientifically conducted--do prove, _indeed_ ANOTHER NATURE' ['almost, can _change_ the stamp of <ORG> word on _this_ point]; 'but being governed by _chance_, doth commonly prove but AN APE of nature, and bringeth forth that which is _lame and counterfeit_.' For not less than that is the difference between the scientific administration of these things, from which the mind _suffereth_, and the blind, hap-hazard one. But in proceeding to the next point on which he ventures to offer some suggestions, that of BOOKS and STUDIES, we shall do well to take with us that general doctrine of _cure_, founded upon the nature of things, which he produces under the head of the cure of the body, with a distinct allusion to its proper application here.

1878,"Amen.” CHAPTER XXIII MRS. <PER>'S CALLER Mrs. <PER> was busily chewing the cud of sweet fancies only, <TIME>. Following the equestrians in their leafy woodland path, she pictured them as talking of their future, and herself built many castles in the air. “Ah,” she thought sentimentally, leaning back in her reclining chair, “how charming is youth--with plenty of money!” She was roused from these luxurious meditations by the appearance of <PER>, bearing a card on a salver. “A man!” she exclaimed with annoyance. “I'm not dressed.” Lifting the card, she read it with a start. “Mr. <PER>.” “Tell him I'll be down soon,” was all she said; but her thoughts ran swiftly as she hurriedly slipped into her gown. “How in the world comes the boy out here? Just as well that <PER> is away. It would only be painful to her, all the old associations.” But old associations cropped up more and more enticingly for Mrs. <PER> as she made her swift toilet, and by the time she reached the drawing-room her eagerness lent her cordiality a very genuine tone. “<PER>, dear boy, how are you?” The young man who rose eagerly to meet her would have been noticeable in any crowd. She gazed up into his smooth-shaven, frank face, with its alert eyes and strong chin, and felt a yearning affection for all which he represented to her. “What are you doing out here?” “Visiting you and <PER>,” he answered, with the hearty relish which always characterized his manner when circumstances were agreeable. “Where is she?” “Riding. I don't know when they will come home, either. It's such a charming day, isn't it? So good of you to hunt us up, <PER>. We've been out of the world so long. I can't tell you what a rush of memories comes over me at sight of you, you nice, big boy. I do believe you've been growing.” She gave a glance of approval at the young man's stalwart proportions. “Oh, don't humiliate me,” he laughed, as she drew him to a divan, where they seated themselves. “How could you get away at <TIME>?” “I'm changing my business, and get a <DATE>'s vacation thereby. Great luck, isn't it?” “I hope so. Are you going to do better?” “Much better.",unknown,VirginiaWoolf,0.9788359999656677,0.9788359999656677,-0.670397937297821

I have some respect for Mrs. <PER>, whoever she is, because she lets him alone. In all the long years we've spent here, when he often had no one to talk to but me, he's let me have a glimpse of these things, and I've told you so's you'd think right about him and serve him all the better.” “He's got a look in his eyes like cold steel,” remarked <PER>, “and lines under 'em like they'd been drawn with steel; and his back's as flat and straight as if a steel rod took the place of a spine. That thick gray hair and mustache of his might be steel threads.” “He's a splendid sight on horseback,” responded Mrs. <PER> devoutly. “His sons were neither of 'em ever the man he is. I'd like to protect him from being imposed upon if such a thing was possible.” “Sho!” drawled '<PER>. “Might's well talk about protecting a battleship.” “Well, '<PER>,” returned his mother, her eyes bright, “can't you imagine a battleship hesitating to run down a little pleasure yacht with all its flags flying? And can't you imagine that hesitation costing the battleship considerable precious time and money? You've said a good deal about my sacrificing my room in the house and coming out here to fix a little home for us both, upstairs in the barn chambers, but perhaps you can see now that it isn't all sacrifice, that perhaps I'm glad of an excuse to get out of the house, where things are so different from what they used to be, and to have a cosy home with my own boy. Now then, '<PER>,” coaxingly, these words recalling her boy's responsibilities, “look over there once more and tell me which of those is the spider.” <PER> dropped the harness and laid his hand gently on his mother's forehead. “There isn't anything there, dear mother,” he said soothingly. “<PER>!” she exclaimed, jerking away with a short reluctant laugh. “'Mother, dear mother, come home with me now,'” he roared sentimentally, so that <ORG> lifted her beautiful head and looked out in surprise.",unknown,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9629160761833191,0.9629160761833191,-2.3552350997924805
1880,"Truly, I could wish I were a wizard, that I might bestride a broomstick, and follow her."" While the young man, involved in these perplexing thoughts, looked forth from the open window of the apartment, his attention was drawn to an individual, evidently of a different, though not of a higher, class than the countrymen among whom he stood. <PER> now recollected that he had noticed his rough dark face among the most earnest of those who had watched the arrival of the party. He had then taken him for <NUM> of the boatmen, of whom there were many in the village, and who had much of a sailor-like dress and appearance. A <NUM> and more attentive observation, however, convinced <PER> that this man's life had not been spent upon fresh water; and, had any stronger evidence than the nameless marks which the ocean impresses upon its sons been necessary, it would have been found in his mode of locomotion. While <PER> was observing him, he beat slowly up to one of Mr. <PER>'s servants who was standing near the door of the inn. He seemed to question the man with affected carelessness; but his countenance was dark and perplexed when he turned to mingle again with the crowd. <PER> lost no time in ascertaining from the servant the nature of his inquiries. They had related to the elopement of Mr. <PER>'s daughter, which was, indeed, the prevailing, if not the sole, subject of conversation in the village. The grounds for supposing that this man was in any way connected with the angler were, perhaps, very slight; yet, in the perplexity of the whole affair, they induced <PER> to resolve to get at the heart of his mystery. To attain this end, he took the most direct method,--by applying to the man himself. He had now retired apart from the throng and bustle of the village, and was seated upon a condemned boat, that was drawn up to rot upon the banks of the river. His arms were folded, and his hat drawn over his brows. The lower part of his face, which alone was visible, evinced gloom and depression, as did also the deep sighs, which, because he thought no one was near him, he did not attempt to restrain. ""Friend, I must speak with you,"" said <PER>, laying his hand upon his shoulder, after contemplating the man a moment, himself unseen. He started at once from his abstraction and his seat, apparently expecting violence, and prepared to resist it; but, perceiving the youthful and solitary intruder upon his privacy, he composed his features with much quickness.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.986914336681366,0.986914336681366,-0.25601086020469666
1882,"They lashed him to the gratings, and ignominiously scourged him under the eye of his old friend and comrade, the <NUM> Lieutenant. This took place while we lay in port, which reminds me of the circumstance, that when punishment is about to be inflicted in harbour, all strangers are ordered ashore; and the sentries at the side have it in strict charge to waive off all boats drawing near. CHAPTER <PER>. A MAN-OF-WAR BUTTON DIVIDES <NUM> BROTHERS. The conduct of <LOC>, in claiming the acquaintance of the <NUM> Lieutenant under such disreputable circumstances was strongly contrasted by the behaviour of another person on board, placed for a time in a somewhat similar situation. Among the genteel youths of the after-guard was a lad of <NUM>, a very handsome young fellow, with starry eyes, curly hair of a golden colour, and a bright, sunshiny complexion: he must have been the son of some goldsmith. He was <NUM> of the few sailors—not in the main-top—whom I used to single out for occasional conversation. After several friendly interviews he became quite frank, and communicated certain portions of his history. There is some charm in the sea, which induces most persons to be very communicative concerning themselves. We had lain in <LOC> but a day, when I observed that this lad—whom I shall here call <PER>—wore an unwonted expression of sadness, mixed with apprehension. I questioned him as to the cause, but he chose to conceal it. Not <DATE> after, he abruptly accosted me on the gun-deck, where I happened to be taking a promenade. “I can’t keep it to myself any more,” he said; “I must have a confidant, or I shall go mad!” “What is the matter?” said I, in alarm. “Matter enough—look at this!” and he handed me a torn <NUM> sheet of an old <LOC> _Herald_, putting his finger upon a particular word in a particular paragraph. It was the announcement of the sailing from <ORG>-yard of a <LOC> store ship, with provisions for the squadron in <LOC>. It was upon a particular name, in the list of officers and midshipmen, that <PER>’s fingers was placed. “That is my own brother,” said he; “he must have got a reefer’s warrant since I left home. Now, White-Jacket, what’s to be done? I have calculated that the store ship may be expected here <DATE>; my brother will then see me—he an officer and I a miserable sailor that any moment may be flogged at the gangway, before his very eyes.

1884,"The change, however, took some time. And it must be admitted that in <LOC>, especially, the Romantic movement was slow to go back to classical themes. <PER> and <PER>, and <PER>—the last, indeed, practically all unknown to his contemporaries—had long rediscovered Antiquity, and felt its pulse anew, and praised its enduring power, when English poetry had little, if anything, to show in answer to the plaintive invocation of <ORG> to the Ancient Muses. The <NUM> generation of English Romantics either shunned the subject altogether, or simply echoed <PER>’s isolated lines in isolated passages as regretful and almost as despondent. From <LOC> to <PER> could wander and seek after exotic themes; <DATE> could be ‘passed among the <ORG> neither the classic lands nor the classic heroes ever seem to have detained him. <PER>’s ‘sphere of sensation may be almost exactly limited by the growth of heather’, as <PER> says; and when he came to <LOC>, his last illness prevented him from any attempt he might have wished to make to enlarge his field of vision. <ORG> was even less far-travelled, and his home-made poetry never thought of the ‘Pagan’ and his ‘creed outworn’, but as a distinct _pis-aller_ in the way of inspiration. And again, though <PER> has a few magnificent lines about them, he seems to have even less willingly than <PER> hearkened after The intelligible forms of ancient poets, The fair humanities of old religion. It was to be otherwise with the later English Romantic poets. They lived and worked at a time when the whole atmosphere and even the paraphernalia of literary composition had just undergone a considerable change. After a period of comparative seclusion and self-concentration, <LOC> at the Peace of Amiens once more found its way to <LOC>—and vice versa. And from our point of view this widening of prospects is especially noticeable. For the classical revival in Romanticism appears to be closely connected with it. It is an alluring subject to investigate. How the progress of scholarship, the recent ‘finds’ of archaeology, the extension of travelling along <LOC> shores, the political enthusiasms evoked by the stirrings of young <LOC> and young <LOC>, all combined to reawaken in the poetical imagination of the times the dormant memories of antiquity has not yet been told by the historians of literature. But—and this is sufficient for our purpose—every one knows what <ORG> have done for <PER> and <PER>; and what inspirations were derived from their pilgrimages in classic lands by all the poets of this and the following generation, from <LOC> to <LOC>.

1888,"His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of <PER> and <PER>, but without the contempt that <PER> had exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure. “I am happy,” said <PER>, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.” He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave. Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.

1889,"The fool shrieks, '<PER>, come not in here,' and out rushes '<PER> o Bedlam'--the naked creature, as <ORG> calls him--with his 'elf locks,' his 'blanketed loins,' his 'begrimed face,' with his shattered wits, his madness, real or assumed--there he stands. We know, indeed, in this instance, that there is gentle, nay, noble blood, there, under that horrid guise. It is the heir of a dukedom, we are told, but an out-cast one, who has found himself compelled, for the sake of prolonging life, to assume that shape, as other wretches were in the Poet's time for that same purpose,--men who had lost _their_ dukedoms, too, as it would seem, such as they were, in some way, and their human relationships, too. But notwithstanding this alleviating circumstance which enables the audience to endure the exhibition in this instance, it serves not the less effectually in the Poet's hand, as 'THE CONSPICUOUS INSTANCE' of that lowest human condition which this grand <ORG> must needs include in its delineations. Here are some of the prose English descriptions of this creature, which we find already included in the commentaries on this tragedy; and which shew that the Poet has not exaggerated his portrait, and that it is not by way of celebrating any Anglo-Saxon or <PER> triumph over the barbarisms of the _joint_ reigns of <PER> _and_ <PER>, that he is produced here.

In the Bellman of London, <DATE>, there is another description of him--'He sweares he hath been in <LOC>, and will talk frantickely _of purpose; you see pinnes_ stuck in sundry places of his _naked flesh_, especially in his armes, _which paine he gladly puts himselfe to_; calls himself by the name of _Poore Tom_; and coming near anybody, cries out, '_Poor <PER>'s a cold_.'",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9943496584892273,0.9943496584892273,-2.377939224243164

1895,"The <ORG>’s cot-boy, the lad who made up his swinging bed and took care of his room, often told us of the horror he sometimes felt when he would find himself alone in his master’s retreat. At times he was seized with the idea that <ORG> was a preternatural being; and once entering his room in the middle watch of <TIME>, he started at finding it enveloped in a thick, bluish vapour, and stifling with the odours of brimstone. Upon hearing a low groan from the smoke, with a wild cry he darted from the place, and, rousing the occupants of the neighbouring state-rooms, it was found that the vapour proceeded from smouldering bunches of lucifer matches, which had become ignited through the carelessness of the Surgeon. Cuticle, almost dead, was dragged from the suffocating atmosphere, and it was <DATE> ere he completely recovered from its effects. This accident took place immediately over the powder magazine; but as <ORG>, during his sickness, paid dearly enough for transgressing the laws prohibiting combustibles in the gun-room, the Captain contented himself with privately remonstrating with him. Well knowing the enthusiasm of the <ORG> for all specimens of morbid anatomy, some of the ward-room officers used to play upon his credulity, though, in every case, <ORG> was not long in discovering their deceptions. Once, when they had some sago pudding for dinner, and <ORG> chanced to be ashore, they made up a neat parcel of this bluish-white, firm, jelly-like preparation, and placing it in a tin box, carefully sealed with wax, they deposited it on the gun-room table, with a note, purporting to come from an eminent physician in <LOC>, connected with <ORG> on the <LOC> d’ <PER>, begging leave to present the scientific <ORG>—with the donor’s compliments—an uncommonly fine specimen of a cancer. Descending to the ward-room, <ORG> spied the note, and no sooner read it, than, clutching the case, he opened it, and exclaimed, “Beautiful! splendid! I have never seen a finer specimen of this most interesting disease.” “What have you there, <ORG>?” said a Lieutenant, advancing. “Why, sir, look at it; did you ever see anything more exquisite?” “Very exquisite indeed; let me have a bit of it, will you, <ORG>?” “Let you have a bit of it!” shrieked the <ORG>, starting back. “Let you have one of my limbs!

1898,"It was as a disgraced and baffled statesman and courtier--all lurking jealousies and suspicions at last put to rest--all possibility of a political future precluded; but as a _courtier_ still hanging on the king and on the power that controlled the king, for _life_ and _liberty_; and careful still not to assert any independence of those same ends, which had always been taken to be his _ends_; it was in this character that he brought out at last the Novum Organum; it was in this character that he ventured to collect and republish his avowed philosophical works; it was in this character too that he ventured at last to produce that little piece of history which comes down to us loosely appended to these philosophical writings.

1899,"He had vowed _to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered <PER> immediately after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard it <TIME>. In this state of mind I wrote to <PER>. My letter was calm and affectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you. <ORG> away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment. I have <NUM> secret, <PER>, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured.

But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.” In <DATE> after the arrival of <PER>’s letter we returned to <LOC>. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was. The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me. <PER> alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah!

1901,"<PER> trembled at the awful scene she would be compelled to witness; but, when death was so near at hand, it was more terrible to stand alone in the dim morning light than even to watch the parting of soul and body. She therefore entered the cottage. Her guide, his face muffled in his cloak, had taken his stand at a Distance from the death-bed, in a part of the room which neither the increasing daylight nor the dim rays of a solitary lamp had yet enlightened. At <PER>'s entrance, the dying woman lay still, and apparently calm, except that a plaintive, <NUM>-articulate sound occasionally wandered through her lips. ""Hush! For mercy's sake, silence!"" whispered the other woman to the strangers. ""There is good hope now that she will die a peaceable death; but, if she is disturbed, the boldest of us will not dare to stand by her bedside."" The whisper by which her sister endeavored to preserve quiet perhaps reached the ears of the dying female; for she now raised herself in bed, slowly, but with a strength superior to what her situation promised. Her face was ghastly and wild, from long illness, approaching death, and disturbed intellect; and a disembodied spirit could scarcely be a more fearful object than one whose soul was just struggling forth. Her sister, approaching with the soft and stealing step appropriate to the chamber of sickness and death, attempted to replace the covering around her, and to compose her again upon the pillow. ""Lie down and sleep, sister,"" she said; ""and, when <DATE> breaks, I will waken you. Methinks your breath comes freer already. A little more slumber, and to-morrow you will be well."" ""My illness is gone: I am well,"" said the dying-woman, gasping for breath. ""I wander where the fresh breeze comes sweetly over my face; but a close and stifled air has choked my lungs."" ""Yet a little while, and you will no longer draw your breath in pain,"" observed her sister, again replacing the bedclothes, which she continued to throw off. ""My husband is with me,"" murmured the widow. ""He walks by my side, and speaks to me as in old times; but his words come faintly on my ear.

1905,"Wherever you find him, under whatever disguise, you will find that his mind is running on the structure of _bodies_, the means of their conservation and growth, and the remedies for their disorders, and decays, and antagonisms, without and within. He has a most extraordinary and incurable natural bent and determination towards medicine and cures in general; he is always inquiring into the anatomy of things and the qualities of drugs, analysing them and mixing them, finding the art of their compounds, and modifying them to suit his purposes, or inventing new ones; for, like <PER>, to whom he refers for a precedent, he wishes 'to have a hand in everything.' But he is not a quack. He has no respect for the old authoritative prescriptions, if they fail in practice, whether they come in <PER>'s name, or another's; but he is just as severe upon 'the empiricutics,' on the other hand, and he objects to 'a horse-drench' for the human constitution in the greater congregation, as much as he does in that distinctively complex delicate structure which the single individual human frame in itself constitutes. Menenius [speaking of the letter which <ORG> has told him of, and putting in a word on this Doctor's behalf, for it is not very much to the purpose on his own] says, 'It gives me an estate of _<DATE>_ health, _during which time I will make a lip at the physician_.' A lip--_a lip_--and 'what a deal of scorn looks beautiful on it,' when once you get to see it. But this is the play of 'conservation with advancement.' It is the cure and preservation of the common-weal, to which all lines are tending, to which all points and parentheses are pointing; and thus he continues: 'The _most sovereign prescription_ in _<PER>_ is but empiricutic, and to _this_ preservative of no better report than a horse-drench.' So we shall find, when we come to try it--_this_ preservative,--this conservation. This Doctor has a great opinion of nature. He thinks that 'the physician must rely on her powers for his cures in the last resort, and be able to make prescriptions of _them_, instead of making them out of his own pre-conceits, if he would not have of his cure a _conceit_ also.'

1911,"The founders of it observed that there were a number of species, which appeared to be maintaining a certain sort of existence of their own, without being dependent for it on the movements within the human brain. To abate the arrogance of the species,--to show the absurdity and ignorance of the attempt to constitute the universe beforehand within that little sphere, the human skull, ignoring the reports of the intelligencers from the universal whole, with which great nature has herself supplied us,--to correct the arrogance and specific bias of the human learning,--was the <NUM> attempt of the new logic.

I beg your pardon. You didn't mean me to see those sweet things you said about me, eh?” “That was no matter. It was cousin <PER>'s secret. She trusted me.” The child's eyes filled with tears.

1923,"While I stood watching the red cigar-end promenading up and down, the mate suddenly stopped and gave an order, and the men sprang to obey it. It was not much, only something about hoisting one of the sails a little higher up on the mast. The men took hold of the rope, and began pulling upon it; the foremost man of all setting up a song with no words to it, only a strange musical rise and fall of notes. In the dark night, and far out upon the lonely sea, it sounded wild enough, and made me feel as I had sometimes felt, when in a twilight room a cousin of mine, with black eyes, used to play some old German airs on the piano. I almost looked round for goblins, and felt just a little bit afraid. But I soon got used to this singing; for the sailors never touched a rope without it. Sometimes, when no one happened to strike up, and the pulling, whatever it might be, did not seem to be getting forward very well, the mate would always say, _“Come, men, can’t any of you sing? Sing now, and raise the dead.”_ And then some one of them would begin, and if every man’s arms were as much relieved as mine by the song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a cheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath expended on it. It is a great thing in a sailor to know how to sing well, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal of popularity among his shipmates. Some sea-captains, before shipping a man, always ask him whether he can sing out at a rope. During the greater part of the watch, the sailors sat on the windlass and told long stories of their adventures by sea and land, and talked about <LOC>, and <LOC>, and <LOC>, and <LOC>, just as you and I would about <PER> and the <PER>. Every man of them almost was a volume of Voyages and Travels round the World. And what most struck me was that like books of voyages they often contradicted each other, and would fall into long and violent disputes about who was keeping the Foul Anchor tavern in <LOC> at such a time; or whether the King of <LOC> lived or did not live in <LOC>; or whether the bar-maid of a particular house in <LOC> had black eyes or blue eyes; with many other mooted points of that sort.",HermanMelville,MarkTwain,0.6935588121414185,0.6935588121414185,-5.752204418182373
1924,"They found, for once, a sober man within, one who is not afraid to tell them, to their teeth, 'Judgment holds in me, always, a magisterial seat;'--and, with all their celestial graces and pretensions, he fetters them, and drags them up to that tribunal. He superintends all his inspirations. There never was a Poet in whom the poetic spontaneities were so absolutely under control and mastery; and there never was one in whose nature all the spontaneous force and faculty of genius showed itself in such tumultuous fulness, ready to issue, at a word, in such inexhaustible varieties of creative energy. Of all the spirits that tend on mortal thoughts there is none to match this so delicate and gorgeous <PER> of his,--this creature that he keeps to put his girdles round the earth for him, that comes at a thought, and brings in such dainty banquets, such brave pageants in the earth or in the air; there is none other that knows so well the spells 'to make this place Paradise.' But, for all that, he is the merest tool,--the veriest drudge and slave. The magician's collar is always on his neck; in his airiest sweeps he takes his chain with him. <PER> himself is not more sternly watched and tutored; and all the gorgeous masque has its predetermined order, its severe economy of grace; through all the slightest minutiæ of its detail, runs the inflexible purpose, the rational _human_ purpose, the common human sense, the common human aim. Yes, it is a Play; but it is the play of a mind sobered with all human learning. Yes, it is spontaneous; but it is the spontaneity of a heart laden with human sorrow, oppressed with the burthen of the common weal. Yes, indeed, it is a Poet's work; but it is the work of one who consciously and deliberately recognizes, in all the variety of his gifts, in all his natural and acquired power, under all the disabilities of his position, the one, <ORG>, human law, and essential obligation. Of 'Art,' as anything whatever, but an instrumentality, thoroughly subdued, and subordinated to _that_ end, of Art as anything in itself, with an independent tribunal, and law with an ethic and ritual of its own, this inventor of the <NUM> Art, that has for its end the relief of the human estate and the Creator's glory, knows nothing.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9759490489959717,0.9759490489959717,-0.8629918098449707
1925,"I put out my tongue, and I sucked the little glass thing because I didn't want to trouble you; but I have too much faith in God to take medicine.” The child looked at the doctor appealingly. He began to see light, and in his surprise, for a moment he did not reply. “<PER> would have used drugs if they had been right,” she added. “But He isn't here now,” returned the astonished young man. “Why, Dr. <PER>,” in gentle reproach, “Christ is the Truth of God. Isn't He here now, healing us and helping us just the same as ever? Didn't He say He would be? You will see how much better I shall be to-night.” Dr. <PER> met the heavy eyes with his own kind, clear ones. “I see you have been taught in new ways, <PER>,” he said seriously, “but you are only a little girl, and while you are in your grandfather's house you ought to do as he wishes. He wishes you to let me prescribe for you. No one who is ill can help making trouble. You have no right not to try to get well in the way Mr. <PER> and Mrs. <PER> wish you to.” <PER> felt herself in a desperate position. The corners of her lips twitched down. Dr. <PER> thought he saw his advantage, and leaned his fine head toward her. She impulsively threw her arms around his neck. “You don't want to hurt my feelings, <PER>,” he said. She was crying softly. “No--it would make me--very--sorry, but it would be--worse--to hurt--God's. Please don't make me, please, please don't make me, Dr. <PER>!” She was increasingly excited, and he feared the effect. “Very well then, <PER>,” he returned. “I don't want to do you more harm than good.” “Oh, thank you!” she exclaimed fervently, through her tears. “But Mrs. <PER> must think you have the medicine. You haven't told her that you are--ahem--a Christian Scientist. I suppose that is what you call yourself.” “Yes, sir. A Christian Scientist.

1926,"""Ahem, I shall be happy to gratify you, young gentleman,"" answered <PER>. ""It is seldom, in this rude country, Master <PER>, that we meet with kindred genius; and the opportunity should never be thrown away."" Thus saying, he took a heavy draught of the liquor by which he was usually inspired, and the praises of which were the prevailing subject of his song; then, after much hemming, thrumming, and prelusion, and with many queer gestures and gesticulations, he began to effuse a lyric in the following fashion:-- I've been a jolly drinker this <NUM>-and-twenty year, And still a jolly drinker, my friends, you see me here: I sing the joys of drinking; bear a chorus, every man, With pint pot and quart pot and clattering of can. The sense of the professor's <NUM> stanza was not in exact proportion to the sound; but, being executed with great spirit, it attracted universal applause. This <PER> appropriated with a condescending bow and smile; and, making a signal for silence, he went on,-- <PER> of old, boys (a jolly king was he),-- But here he was interrupted by a clapping of hands, that seemed a continuance of the applause bestowed on his former stanza. <PER>, who, as is the custom of many great performers, usually sang with his eyes shut, now opened them, intending gently to rebuke his auditors for their unseasonable expression of delight. He immediately perceived, however, that the fault was to be attributed to neither of the <NUM> young men; and, following the direction of their eyes, he saw near the door, in the dim background of the apartment, a figure in a cloak. The hat was flapped forward, the cloak muffled round the lower part of the face; and only the eyes were visible. The party gazed a moment in silence, and then rushed _en masse_ upon the intruder, the landlord bringing up the rear, and sounding a charge upon his fiddle. But, as they drew nigh, the black cloak began to assume a familiar look; the hat, also, was an old acquaintance; and, these being removed, from beneath them shone forth the reverend face and form of Dr. <PER>. The president, in his quality of clergyman, had, late in <TIME>, been called to visit an aged female who was supposed to be at the point of death. Her habitation was at the distance of several miles from <ORG>; so that it was nightfall before Dr. <PER> stood at her bedside.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9840493202209473,0.9840493202209473,-0.3930226266384125
1927,"he exclaimed <TIME> when this trial was being undergone. ""But you needn't mind it, need you, since it isn't your fault?"" returned Mrs. <PER> cheerfully. ""So many good years are coming for you to study and learn in."" ""What will happen when <DATE> is over?"" asked the boy. ""Are you going to take me with you? Will Mr. <PER> like me?"" ""Indeed, he will. I am going to have you live near me."" ""Not with you?"" ""No, <PER>, that wouldn't be best. I have been corresponding with a very nice young man whom I have known a long time, and he will be pleased to live with you and give you lessons."" ""In drawing?"" asked the boy. ""No, sir."" Mrs. <PER> gave him the gay, smiling look he liked: it was so full of everything cheerful and kind. ""No, sir, reading and writing and 'rithmetic."" ""Oh,"" returned <PER>, looking very serious. ""<NUM> you must give your time to study. Education is the foundation. Then, later, when you have gone through college--Oh, how proud I shall be when I go to see you graduate!"" ""Shall you ever be proud of me?"" asked the boy slowly. ""If you will let me,"" she answered. ""It all remains with you."" ""Then--then I'll try. I would rather stay with Mr. <PER> when you go away, but if you want me to, I'll live with the young man."" ""You will like him. He is <DATE>, and he wants to go to college when he gets money enough.

1928,"The party had now turned their horses, and were about to resume their ride in a homeward direction; but <PER> perceived that <PER>, having lost the excitement of intense thought, now looked weary and dispirited. ""Here is a cottage close at hand,"" he observed. ""We have ridden far, and stand in need of refreshment. <PER>, shall we alight?"" She saw the benevolent motive of his proposal, and did not hesitate to comply with it. But, as they paused at the cottage door, she could not but observe that its exterior promised few of the comforts which they required. <ORG> and neglect seemed to have conspired for its ruin; and, but for a thin curl of smoke from its clay chimney, they could not have believed it to be inhabited. A considerable tract of land in the vicinity of the cottage had evidently been, at some former period, under cultivation, but was now overrun by bushes and dwarf pines, among which many huge gray rocks, ineradicable by human art, endeavored to conceal themselves. <NUM> an acre of ground was occupied by the young blades of Indian-corn, at which a <NUM>-starved cow gazed wistfully over the mouldering log-fence. These were the only agricultural tokens. <PER>, nevertheless, drew the latch of the cottage door, after knocking loudly but in vain. The apartment which was thus opened to their view was quite as wretched as its exterior had given them reason to anticipate. Poverty was there, with all its necessary and unnecessary concomitants. The intruders would have retired had not the hope of affording relief detained them. The occupants of the small and squalid apartment were <NUM> women, both of them elderly, and, from the resemblance of their features, appearing to be sisters. The expression of their countenances, however, was very different. <NUM>, evidently the younger, was seated on the farther side of the large hearth, opposite to the door at which the party stood. She had the sallow look of long and wasting illness; and there was an unsteadiness of expression about her eyes, that immediately struck the observer. Yet her face was mild and gentle, therein contrasting widely with that of her companion. The other woman was bending over a small fire of decayed branches, the flame of which was very disproportionate to the smoke, scarcely producing heat sufficient for the preparation of a scanty portion of food. Her profile only was visible to the strangers, though, from a slight motion of her eye, they perceived that she was aware of their presence.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9869488477706909,0.9869488477706909,-0.199559286236763
1929,"“I read part of it once. That was enough for me. Think of the price they charge for it, too. Think of pretending it is such a good thing for everybody to have, and then putting a price on it that prohibits the average pocketbook.” <PER>'s smile annoyed her mother. “Weren't you with me the day <PER> mother said so much about it?” “How foolish she was not to try it,” said <PER>. “Such a hopeless, monotonous invalid.” “Well, some of her friends worked hard enough to induce her to, but when she found out the mercenary side of it, she saw at once that it couldn't be trustworthy.” “I suppose even Christian Scientists must have a roof and food and clothes,” returned <PER> coolly; “but I've thought a good deal <DATE> about the criticisms I've heard on the price of the book. The fuss over that <MONEY> is certainly very funny, when the average pocketbook goes to the theatre sometimes, has flowers for its entertainments, and rejoices to find lace reduced from a dollar and a quarter to ninety-five cents a yard for its gowns. It eagerly hoards and spends <MONEY> for some passing pleasure or effect, but winces and ponders over paying the same sum for a book that will last a lifetime, and which, if it is worth anything, furnishes the key to every problem in life.” “But why isn't it as cheap as the Bible if it is so beneficial?” “It will be, probably, when it is generally respected. For the present it wouldn't be wise to cast it about like pearls before swine.” <PER> smiled at herself. “You see I'm talking as if I knew it all. My wisdom comes partially from what I have extracted from <ORG>, and partly from what is obvious. I haven't reached the place yet where I am convinced, but this book is wonderfully interesting. It came to me in <TIME> I have ever known, and it has--it has seemed to feed me when I was starving. I don't know how else to put it. I can't think of anything else. Mother, why haven't we a Bible? I was ashamed when <PER> asked me.” Mrs. <PER>, astonished and dismayed by her daughter's earnestness, drew herself up. “We have a Bible, certainly.

1930,"She knew not what to dread; but she was well aware that danger was at hand, and that, in the deep wilderness, there was none to help her, except that Being with whose inscrutable purposes it might consist to allow the wicked to triumph for a season, and the innocent to be brought low. ""Are you so soon weary of this quiet retreat?"" demanded her guide, continuing to wear the same sneering smile.

But, as she spoke these words, the expression of his face was changed, becoming suddenly so dark and fiend-like, that she clasped her hands, and fell on her knees before him.

1931,"He had also made his resolution strong, that he would not even endeavor to win <PER>'s love, the result of which, for <NUM> reasons, could not be happiness. Firm in this determination, and confident of his power to adhere to it; feeling, also, that time and absence could not cure his own passion, and having no desire for such a cure,--he saw no reason for breaking off the intercourse that was established between <PER> and himself. It was remarkable, that, notwithstanding the desperate nature of his love, that, or something connected with it, seemed to have a beneficial effect upon his health. There was now a slight tinge of color in his cheek, and a less consuming brightness in his eye. Could it be that hope, unknown to himself, was yet alive in his breast; that a sense of the possibility of earthly happiness was redeeming him from the grave? Had the character of <PER> mind been different, there might, perhaps, have been danger to her from an intercourse of this nature with such a being as <PER>; for he was distinguished by many of those asperities around which a woman's affection will often cling. But she was formed to walk in the calm and quiet paths of life, and to pluck the flowers of happiness from the wayside where they grow. Singularity of character, therefore, was not calculated to win her love. She undoubtedly felt an interest in the solitary student, and perceiving, with no great exercise of vanity, that her society drew him from the destructive intensity of his studies, she perhaps felt it a duty to exert her influence. But it did not occur to her that her influence had been sufficiently strong to change the whole current of his thoughts and feelings. <PER> and her <NUM> lovers (for both, though perhaps not equally, deserved that <PER>) had met, as usual, at the close of a sweet <DATE>, and were standing by the side of the stream, just where it swept into a deep pool.

It is that I do not believe that nature exists.” “Exists?” said <PER> in his monotonous way, settling his pewter pot on the table. “Yes, in a real sense nature does not exist.

1939,"The reader who does not think that is, on the whole, a successful paragraph, considering the general slipperiness of the subject, and the state of the ice in those parts of it, in particular where the movements appear to be the most free and graceful; such a one has, probably, failed in applying to it, that key of 'times,' which a _full occasion_ is expected to produce for this kind of delivery. But if any doubt exists in any mind, in regard to this author's opinion of the rights of his own profession and vocation, and _the circle_ of _its_ office and duties,--if any one really doubts what only allegiance this author professionally acknowledges, and what kingship it is to which this great argument is internally dedicated, it may be well to recall the statement on that subject, which he has taken occasion to insert in another part of the work, so that that point, at least, may be satisfactorily determined. He is speaking of 'certain base conditions and courses,' in his criticism on the manners of learned men, which he says 'he has no purpose to give allowance to, wherein divers professors of learning have wronged themselves and gone too far,'--glancing in particular at the trencher philosophers of <DATE> of the Roman state, 'who were little better than parasites in the houses of the great. But above all the rest,' he continues, 'the _gross_ and _palpable flattery_, <PER>, many, not unlearned, have abased and abused their wits and pens, turning, as <PER> saith, <ORG> into <LOC>, and <ORG> into <PER>, hath most diminished the price and estimation of learning. Neither is the _modern dedication_, of books and writings _as to patrons_, to be commended: for that books--such as are _worthy the name of books_, ought to have _no patrons, but_--(hear) but--Truth and Reason. And the ancient custom was to dedicate them only to _private and equal friends_, or to _entitle_ the books with their names, or if to _kings_ and _great persons_, it was _some such_ as the argument of the book was fit and proper for: but these and the like courses may deserve rather _reprehension_ than defence. 'Not that I can tax,' he continues, however, 'or condemn the application of learned men to men in fortune.'",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9742656946182251,0.9742656946182251,-0.9124382138252258

Her cheeks were very red, but even the disconcerted housekeeper could see that she was not excited or angry. “Everybody loves good little girls,” returned Mrs. <PER>. “Now eat your dinner, <LOC>, so I can carry down the tray.” “I did eat the bread. It was all I wanted. It was very nice.” The polite addition made the housekeeper uncertain. While she paused <PER> added, “I wish I could see grandpa.” “He's gone out on business.

1942,"The position which these reformers occupy, is one so high, that the question of different kinds of soils, and chemical analyses and experiments, would not come within their range at all; and 'the resplendent or lustrous mass of matter,' of which their sciences are compounded, chosen to give glory either to the subtilty of disputations or to the eloquence of discourses, would not bear any such vulgar admixture. It would make a terrible jar in the rhythm, which those large generalizations naturally flow in, to undertake to introduce into them any such points of detail. And the new teacher will have a mountain too; but it will be one that 'overlooks the vale,' and he will have a rock-cut-stair to its utmost summit. He is one who will undertake this despised unlustrous matter of which our ordinary human life consists, and make a science of it, building up its generalizations from its particulars, and observing the actual reality,--the thing as it is, freshly, for that purpose; and not omitting any detail,--the poorest. The poets who had undertaken this theme before had been so absorbed with the idea of what man should be, that they could only glance at him as he is: the idea of a science of him, was not of course, to be thought of. There was but <NUM> name for the creature, indeed, in their vocabulary and doctrine, and that was one which simply seized and embodied the general fact, the unquestionable historic fact, that he has not been able hitherto to attain to his ideal type in nature, or indeed to make any satisfactory approximation to it. But when <ORG> sits at last, and the business begins to assume a systematic form, even the science of that ideal good, that exemplar and pattern of good, which men have been busy on so long,--the _science_ of it,--is put down as 'wanting,' and the _science_ of the _husbandry <ORG>_, '_wholly deficient_.' And the report is, that this new argument, notwithstanding its <DATE> theme, is one that admits of being sung also; and that the <PER> who is able to compose 'these Georgies of the Mind,' may promise himself fame, though his end is one that will enable him to forego it. Let us see if we can find any further track of him and his great argument, whether in prose or verse;--this poet who cares not whether he has his 'singing robes' about him or not, so he can express and put upon record his new 'observations of this husbandry.'",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.791818380355835,0.791818380355835,-3.358114004135132

The occasion that called forth his energies had passed; and they had left him. ""Forgive me, Miss <PER>,"" he said almost humbly, ""if my eagerness to serve you has led me too far.

Noting Mrs. <PER>'s set countenance, she added apologetically, “They're so pretty, cousin <PER> and aunt <ORG>, I love to look at them, but they aren't my real relations, and,” her face gladdening again, “to think of having breakfast alone with you, grandpa, makes me feel as if--as if I had a birthday!” Mr. <PER> cleared his throat.

Even in this, when science has enlightened it, and it is impelled by blind and unsuccessful instinct no longer, the man of science finds a place where a pillar of the true state can be planted; even here the scientific light lays bare, in the actualities of the human constitution, a foundation-stone,--a stone that does not crumble--a stone that does not roll, which the state that shall stand must rest on. Even that 'active good,' which impels 'the troublers of the world, such as was <PER>, and infinite others in smaller model,'--that principle which impels the particular nature to leave its signature on other things,--on the state, on the world, if it can,--though it is its own end, and though it is apt, when armed with those singular powers for 'effecting its _good_ will,' which are represented in the hero of this action, to lead to results of the kind which this piece represents,--this is the principle in man which seeks an individual immortality, and works of immortal worth for man are its natural and selectest means.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9806807637214661,0.9806807637214661,-0.7214738130569458

'The greater part carries it. If he would but incline to the people, There never was a worthier man.' And yet, after all, that is what he wants for them, and must have or he is nothing; for as the Poet tells us elsewhere, 'our monarchs and our outstretched heroes are but the beggar's shadows.' The difficulty is, that he wishes to take his 'hire' in some more quiet way, without being rudely reminded of the nature of the transaction. But the Poet's toils are about him. The man of science has caught the hero, the king in germ; the dragon wings are not yet spread. He wishes to exhibit the embryo monarch in this particular stage of his development, and the scientific process proceeds with as little regard to the victim's wishes, as if he were indeed that humble product of nature to which the Poet likens him. 'There's a differency between a grub and a butterfly; yet your butterfly was a grub.' Just on that step between 'the casque and the cushion,' the philosopher arrests him. For this history denotes, as we have seen, a foregone conclusion. The scholar has privately anatomized in his study the dragon's wings, and this theatrical synthesis is designed to be an instructive one. He wishes to show, in a palpable form, what _is_ and what is _not_, essential to the mechanism of that greatness which, though it presents itself to the eye in the contemptible physique, and moral infirmity and pettiness of the human individual, is yet clothed with powers so monstrous, so real, so terrific, that all men are afflicted with them;--this thing in which 'the conditions of a man are so altered,' this thing which 'has grown from man to dragon, which is more than a creeping thing.' He will show that after all it is nothing in the world but the _popular power_ itself, the power of the people instinctively, unscientifically and unartistically exercised. The Poet has analysed that so potent name by which men call it, and he will show upon his stage, by that same method which his followers have made familiar to us, in other departments of investigation, the elements of its power.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9952927827835083,0.9952927827835083,-1.7310887575149536

She mused concerning him while she was taking off <PER> hat and jacket up in her own room. “I don't suppose you could understand much what he meant, <PER>,” she said, her face very sober from stress of thought, “but I did. If I'd been as big as mother I could have helped him; but I knew I was too little, and when people don't understand, mother says it is so easy to make mistakes in what you say to them.” <PER> silence gave assent, and her sweet expression was always a solace to <LOC>, who kissed the hard roses in her cheeks repeatedly before she sat her in the big chair by the window and went down to lunch. <PER> forced abstemiousness had ceased to afflict her. At the lunch table she gave a vivacious account of the <TIME>'s diversions, and for once Mrs. <PER> listened to what she said, a curious expression on her face. This lady had expected to endure annoyance with this child on her grandfather's account; but for unkind fate to cause <PER> to be a hindrance and a marplot in the case of Dr. <PER> was adding insult to injury. The child, suddenly catching the expression of Mrs. <PER>'s eyes as they rested upon her, was startled, and ceased talking. “<PER> does love me,” she declared mentally. “God's children love one another every minute, <TIME>.” “So Mr. <PER> told you where you can go to church,” said <PER>, replying to <ORG>'s last bit of information. “Yes, and”--the little girl was going on eagerly to suggest that her cousin accompany her, when suddenly Dr. <PER>'s eyes seemed looking at her and repeating their protest. She stopped, and ate for a time in silence. Mrs. <PER> paid little attention to what was being said.",unknown,VirginiaWoolf,0.9844628572463989,0.9844628572463989,-0.2544521689414978
1972,"""I really hardly follow you, Mrs. <PER>,"" cried <PER> in despair. ""He has no profession. But he has nice tastes. He reads Browning every night. And he is most amazingly strong. When he was younger we used to put on the gloves together, but I cannot persuade him to now, for he says he cannot play light enough. I should allow him <NUM>, which should be enough at <NUM>."" ""My dear Mrs. <PER>,"" cried <PER>, ""I assure you that I have not the least idea what it is that you are talking of."" ""Do you think your sister <PER> would have my nephew <PER>?"" Her sister <PER>? Quite a little thrill of relief and of pleasure ran through her at the thought. <PER> and <PER>. She had never thought of it. And yet they had been a good deal together. They had played tennis. They had shared the tandem tricycle. Again came the thrill of joy, and close at its heels the cold questionings of conscience. Why this joy? What was the real source of it? Was it that deep down, somewhere pushed back in the black recesses of the soul, there was the thought lurking that if <PER> prospered in his wooing then <PER> would still be free? How mean, how unmaidenly, how unsisterly the thought! She crushed it down and thrust it aside, but still it would push up its wicked little head. She crimsoned with shame at her own baseness, as she turned once more to her companion. ""I really do not know,"" she said. ""She is not engaged?"" ""Not that I know of."" ""You speak hesitatingly."" ""Because I am not sure. But he may ask. She cannot but be flattered."" ""Quite so. I tell him that it is the most practical compliment which a man can pay to a woman. He is a little shy, but when he sets himself to do it he will do it. He is very much in love with her, I assure you. These little lively people always do attract the slow and heavy ones, which is nature's device for the neutralizing of bores. But they are all going in. I think if you will allow me that I will just take the opportunity to tell him that, as far as you know, there is no positive obstacle in the way.""

1974,"The work is popular in its form, but it is inwoven throughout with a thread of lurking meanings so near the surface, and at times so boldly obtruded, that it is difficult to understand how it could ever have been read at all without occasioning the inquiry which it was intended to occasion under certain conditions, but which it was necessary for this society to ward off from their works, except under these limitations, at the time when they were issued. For these inner meanings are everywhere pointed and emphasized with the most bold and vivid illustration, which lies on the surface of the work, in the form of stories, often without any apparent relevance in that exterior connection--brought in, as it would seem, in mere caprice or by the loosest threads of association. They lie, with the 'allegations' which accompany them, strewn all over the surface of the work, like 'trap' on 'sand-stone,' telling their story to the scientific eye, and beckoning the philosophic explorer to that primeval granite of sciences that their vein will surely lead to. But the careless observer, bent on recreation, observes only a pleasing feature in the landscape, one that breaks happily its threatened dulness; the reader, reading this book as _books_ are wont to be read, finds nothing in this phenomenon to excite his curiosity. And the author knows him and his ways so well, that he is able to foresee that result, and is not afraid to trust to it in the case of those whose scrutiny he is careful to avoid. For he is one who counts largely on the carelessness, or the indifference, or the stupidity of those whom he addresses. There is no end to his confidence in that. He is perpetually staking his life on it. Neither is he willing to trust to the clues which these unexplained stories might seem of themselves to offer to the studious eye, to engage the attention of the reader--the reader whose attention he is bent on securing. Availing himself of <NUM> of those nooks of discourse, which he is at no loss for the means of creating when the purpose of his _essaie_ requires it, he beckons the confidential reader aside, and thus explains his method to him, outright, in terms which admit of but <NUM> construction.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9861518740653992,0.9861518740653992,-0.4222664535045624
1976,"We should not need, perhaps, the aid of the explanations already quoted, to show us that the author does not confess this custom of his for the sake of commending it to the sense or judgment of the reader,--who sees it here for the <NUM> time it may be put into words or put on paper, who looks at it here, perhaps, for the <NUM> time objectively, from the critical stand-point which the review of another's confession creates; and though it may have been latent in the dim consciousness of his own experience, or practically developed, finds it now for the <NUM> time, collected from the phenomena of the blind, instinctive, human motivity, and put down on the page of science, as a principle in nature, in human nature also. But this is indeed a Spartan combing and curling, that the author is falling to, in the introductory flourishes ('diversions' as he calls them) of this great adventure, that his pen is out for now: he is indeed upon the point of running headlong into the fiercest dangers;--it is the state, the wretched, discased, vicious state, dying apparently, yet full of teeth and mischief, that he is about to handle in his argument with these fine, lightsome, frolicsome preparations of his, without any perceptible 'mittens'; it is the heart of that political evil that his time groans with, and begins to find insufferable, that he is going to probe to the quick with that so delicate weapon. It is a tilt against the block and the rack, and all the instruments of torture, that he is going to manage, as handsomely, and with as many sacrifices to the graces, as the circumstances will admit of. But the political situation which he describes so boldly (and we have already seen what it is) affects us here in its relation to the question of style only, and as the author himself connects it with the point of our inquiry. 'A man may regret,' he says, 'the better times, but cannot fly from the present, we may wish for other magistrates, but we must, notwithstanding, obey those we have; and, peradventure, it is more laudable to obey the bad than the good, so long as the image of the ancient and received laws of this monarchy shall shine in any corner of the kingdom.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9509575963020325,0.9509575963020325,-1.7559677362442017

1981,"Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for <TIME>, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes. How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape. As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?” “You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice. “Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.” I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.” “I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.” While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me.

1987,"As I fondly glanced over the leaves, like one who loves more than he chides, my eye lighted upon a passage concerning _“The Old Dock,”_ which much aroused my curiosity. I determined to see the place without delay: and walking on, in what I presumed to be the right direction, at last found myself before a spacious and splendid pile of sculptured brown stone; and entering the porch, perceived from incontrovertible tokens that it must be the Custom-house. After admiring it awhile, I took out my guide-book again; and what was my amazement at discovering that, according to its authority, I was entirely mistaken with regard to this <ORG>-house; for precisely where I stood, _“The Old Dock”_ must be standing, and reading on concerning it, I met with this very apposite passage:—_“The <NUM> idea that strikes the stranger in coming to this dock, is the singularity of so great a number of ships afloat in the very heart of the town, without discovering any connection with the sea.”_ Here, now, was a poser! Old <PER> confessed that there was a good deal of “singularity” about the thing; nor did he pretend to deny that it was, without question, amazing, that this fabulous dock should seem to have no _connection with the sea!_ However, the same author went on to say, that the _“astonished stranger must suspend his wonder for awhile, and turn to the left.”_ But, right or left, no place answering to the description was to be seen. This was too confounding altogether, and not to be easily accounted for, even by making ordinary allowances for the growth and general improvement of the town in the course of <DATE>.

It seems that in this place originally stood the _“pool,”_ from which the town borrows a part of its name, and which originally wound round the greater part of the old settlements; that this pool was made into the “Old Dock,” for the benefit of the shipping; but that, <DATE>, it had been filled up, and furnished the site for the Custom-house before me.",HermanMelville,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9772737622261047,0.9772737622261047,-0.7145287394523621

Dr. <PER> had followed his own fancies in the mode of laying out his garden; and, in consequence, the plan that had undoubtedly existed in his mind was utterly incomprehensible to every one but himself. It was an intermixture of kitchen and flower garden, a labyrinth of winding paths, bordered by hedges, and impeded by shrubbery. Many of the original trees of the forest were still flourishing among the exotics which the doctor had transplanted thither. It was not without a sensation of fear, stronger than she had ever before experienced, that <PER> found herself in this artificial wilderness, and in the presence of the mysterious stranger. The dusky light deepened the lines of his dark, strong features; and <PER> fancied that his countenance wore a wilder and a fiercer look than when she had met him by the stream. He perceived her agitation, and addressed her in the softest tones of which his voice was capable. ""Compose yourself,"" he said; ""you have nothing to fear from me. But we are in open view from the house, where we now stand; and discovery would not be without danger to both of us."" ""No eye can see us here,"" said <PER>, trembling at the truth of her own observation, when they stood beneath a gnarled, low-branched pine, which Dr. <PER>'s ideas of beauty had caused him to retain in his garden. ""Speak quickly; for I dare follow you no farther."" The spot was indeed sufficiently solitary; and the stranger delayed no longer to explain his errand. ""Your father,"" he <ORG> you not love him?

Because this is science, and not philosophy in the sense which that word still conveys, when applied to subjects of this nature. We all know that the scientific man is a safe and brilliant practitioner. The most unspeculative men of practice have learned to prefer him and his arts to the best empiricism. It is the philosophers we have had in this field, with their rash anticipations,--with their unscientific pre-conceptions,--with a _pre-conception_, instead of a fore-knowledge of the power they deal with, commanding results which do not,--there is the point,--which do not follow.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9594222903251648,0.9594222903251648,-2.8746793270111084
1994,"He alludes here too, in passing, to some other distinctions of method, which are already received, that of ANALYSIS and _synthesis_, or CONSTITUTION, that of _concealment_, or <ORG>, which he says 'he allows well of, though he has himself stood upon those which are least handled and observed.' He brings out his doctrine of the necessity of a method which shall include _particulars_ for _practical_ purposes also, under another head: here it is the limit of _rules_,--the propositions or precepts of _arts_ that he speaks of, and the _degree_ of particularity which these precepts ought to descend to. 'For every knowledge,' he says, 'may be fitly said to have a latitude and longitude, accounting the latitude towards _other sciences_' (for there are rules and propositions of such latitude as to include all arts, all sciences)--'and the longitude towards action, that is, from the greatest generality, to the most particular precept: and as to the degree of particularity to which a knowledge should descend,' though something must, of course, be left in all departments to the discretion of the practitioner, he thinks it is a question which will bear looking into in a general way; and that it might be possible to have rules in all departments, which would limit very much the necessity of individual experiment, and not leave us so much at the mercy of individual discretion in the most serious matters. Philosophy, as he finds it, does not appear to be very helpful to practice, on account of its keeping to those general propositions, so much, as well as on some other accounts, and has fallen into bad repute, it seems, among men who find it necessary to make, without science, as they best can, rules of some sort;--rules that are capable of dealing with that quality in particulars which is apt to be called _obstinacy_ in this aspect of it. 'For we see remote and superficial generalities do but offer knowledge to scorn of practical men, and are no more aiding to practice, than an <ORG>'s _universal map_ is to direct the way between <LOC> and <LOC>.' And what is this itself but a universal map, this map of the advancement of learning? All this doctrine of the tradition of sciences, he produces under the head of the _method_ of their tradition, but in speaking of the _organ_ of it, he treats it _exclusively_ as the medium of tradition for _those sciences which require_ CONCEALMENT, or admit only of a suggestive exhibition.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9607605338096619,0.9607605338096619,-2.880812883377075

2000,"The concentration of genius and science on it, henceforth,--the _gradual_ adaptation of all these grand remedial agencies to this common end,-- this end which all truly enlightened minds will conspire for,--find to be _their own_,--this is the plan;--this is the sober day-dream of the Elizabethan Reformer; this is the plot of the Elizabethan Revolutionist. This is the radicalism that he is setting on foot. This is the cure of the state which he is undertaking. We want to command effects, and the way to do that is to find causes; and we must find them according to the new method, and not by reasoning it thus and thus, for the result is just the same, this philosopher observes, as if we had not reasoned it thus and thus, but some other way. That is the difficulty with that method, which is in use here at present, which this philosopher calls 'common logic.' Life goes on, life as it is and was, in the face of our reasonings; but it goes on in the dark; the phenomena are on the surface in the form of EFFECTS, and all our weal and woe is in them; but the CAUSES are beneath unexplored. They are able to give us certain impressions of their _natures_; they strike us, and blast us, it may be, by way of teaching us _something_ of their powers; but _we do not know them_; they are within our own souls and lives, and we do not _know_ them; not because they lie without the range of a scientific enquiry, but _because_ we will not apply to them _the scientific method_; because the old method of 'preconception' here is still considered the true one. The plan of this great scientific enterprise was one which embraced, from the <NUM>, the whole body of the common-weal. It concerned itself immediately and directly with all the parts and members of the social state, from the king on his throne to the beggar in his straw. Its aim was to disclose ultimately, and educate in every member of society that entire and noble form of human nature which 'each man carries with him,' and whereby the individual man is naturally and constitutionally a member of the common-weal. Its proposition was to develop ultimately and educate--successfully educate--in each integer of the state, the integral principle--the principle whereby in man the true conservation and integrity of the part--the virtue, and felicity, and perfection, of the part, tend to the weal of the whole--tend to perfect and advance the whole.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9250800013542175,0.9250800013542175,-2.1260364055633545
2001,"'Some may raise this question,' he says, talking as he does sometimes in the historical plural of his philosophic chair,--'_this question, rather than objection_,'--[it was much to be preferred in that form certainly]--'whether we talk of perfecting NATURAL PHILOSOPHY alone, according to our method, or _the other sciences such as_--ETHICS, LOGIC, POLITICS.'

'Whether we talk of _perfecting politics_ with our method,' <LOC> politics,--and not politics only, but whether we talk of _perfecting 'ethics'_ with it also, and 'logic,--common logic,' which last is as much in need of perfecting as anything, and the beginning of perfecting of that is the reform in the others.

I should not have understood the purport of this book had not <PER>, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the <ORG> authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with <ORG> over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants. “These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9884240031242371,0.9884240031242371,-0.819674551486969

He saw the great thoroughfare that sloped upward to the base of its huge pedestal of steps. And he wondered whether the little shop was still by the side of it and whether its window had been mended. As the flying ship swept round the dome he observed other alterations. The dome had been redecorated so as to give it a more solemn and somewhat more ecclesiastical note; the ball was draped or destroyed, and round the gallery, under the cross, ran what looked like a ring of silver statues, like the little leaden images that stood round the hat of <PER>.

2014,"More than once, during the progress of dressing, he was inclined to believe that the duel had actually taken place, and been fatal to him, and that he was now in those regions to which, his conscience told him, such an event would be likely to send him. This idea resulted from his bodily sensations, which were in the highest degree uncomfortable. He was tormented by a raging thirst, that seemed to have absorbed all the moisture of his throat and stomach; and, in his present agitation, a cup of icy water would have been his <NUM> wish, had all the treasures of earth and sea been at his command. His head, too, throbbed almost to bursting; and the whirl of his brain at every movement promised little accuracy in the aim of his pistol, when he should meet the angler.

In the mean time, his head was, perhaps, still too much confused to allow him fully to realize his unpleasant situation.

Her companion reddened under the look of surprise she bent upon him, her lovely lips unsteady. “No offense,” he added hastily. “<ORG>'s sentiments are evident enough, and he is a fine fellow.” <PER> controlled herself. “Will you take the trouble to explain our affairs to me?” she asked. “Certainly,” responded Mr. <PER> quickly. “I wish for your sake there was more to explain, more possibilities in the case.” “We have nothing?” exclaimed the girl acutely. “Your father took heavy chances and lost. His affairs are nearly settled, and what there is left is small indeed.” The speaker cast a quick glance at the girl beside him. She had caught her lip between her teeth. <ORG>'s soft voice sounded in his ears. “Cousin <PER> feels sorry because she isn't your real relation.” An inkling of what the girl might suffer came to him. “Your mother and you have a claim upon me,” he went on. “I should certainly feel a responsibility of all my son's debts, and the one to his wife and daughter in particular.",unknown,VirginiaWoolf,0.9744248390197754,0.9744248390197754,-1.482253909111023
2017,"Then for an instant there hung and broke above him like a high wave the whole horror of scientific imprisonment, which manages to deny a man not only liberty, but every accidental comfort of bondage. In the old filthy dungeons men could carve their prayers or protests in the rock. Here the white and slippery walls escaped even from bearing witness. The old prisoners could make a pet of a mouse or a beetle strayed out of a hole. Here the unpierceable walls were washed every morning by an automatic sluice. There was no natural corruption and no merciful decay by which a living thing could enter in. Then <PER> looked up and saw the high invincible hatefulness of the society in which he lived, and saw the hatefulness of something else also, which he told himself again and again was not the cosmos in which he believed. But all the time he had never once doubted that the <NUM> sides of his cell were for him the wall of the world henceforward, and it gave him a shock of surprise even to discover the faint light through the aperture in the ventilation tube.

The light that came up from beyond was very faint, and apparently indirect; it seemed to fall from some hole or window higher up. As he was screwing his eye to peer at this grey and greasy twilight he was astonished to see another human finger very long and lean come down from above towards the broken pipe and hook it up to something higher. The lighted aperture was abruptly blackened and blocked, presumably by a face and mouth, for something human spoke down the tube, though the words were not clear. “Who is that?” asked <PER>, trembling with excitement, yet wary and quite resolved not to spoil any chance. After a few indistinct sounds the voice came down with a strong <PER> accent: “I say, <PER>, we couldn't fight through this tube, could we?” Sentiments beyond speech surged up in <PER> and silenced him for a space just long enough to be painful.

2018,"And Lord Bacon quotes this story too, as he does many others, which this author has _<NUM> selected_, and for the same purpose; for, not content with appropriating his philosophy, and pretending to invent his design and his method, he borrows all his most significant stories from him, and brings them in to illustrate the same points, and the points are borrowed also: he makes use, indeed, of his common-place book throughout in the most shameless and unconscionable manner. 'Rack his style, <PER>, _rack his style_?' he said to <PER>, as he tells us, when she consulted him--he being then of her counsel learned, in the case of Dr. <PER>, charged with having written 'the book of the deposing of <PER> the <NUM>, and the _coming in_ of Henry the Fourth,' and sent to the Tower for that offence. The queen was eager for a different kind of advice. Racking an author's book did not appear to her coarse sensibilities, perfectly unconscious of the delicacy of an author's susceptibilities, a process in itself sufficiently murderous to satisfy her revenge. There must be some flesh and blood in the business before ever she could understand it. She wanted to have 'the question' put to that gentleman as to his meaning in the obscure passages in that work under the most impressive circumstances; and Mr. <PER>, _himself_ an author, being of her counsel learned, was requested to make out a case of treason for her; and wishes from such a source were understood to be commands in <DATE>. Now it happened that one of the managers and actors at the Globe Theatre, who was at that time sustaining, as it would seem, the most extraordinary relations of intimacy and friendship with the friends and patrons of this same person, then figuring as the queen's adviser, had recently composed a tragedy on this very subject; though that gentleman, more cautious than Dr. <PER>, and having, perhaps, some learned counsel also, had taken the precaution to keep back the scene of the deposing of royalty during the life-time of this sharp-witted queen, reserving its publication for the reign of her erudite successor; and the learned counsel in this case being aware of the fact, may have felt some sympathy with this misguided author. 'No, madam,' he replied to her inquiry, thinking to take off her bitterness with a merry conceit, as he says, 'for treason I can _not_ deliver opinion that there is any, but very much felony.'

2020,"“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I ought to have familiarised the old <PER> to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach.

MacIan sat rigid, but peered after him with open and parched lips. He saw the sight which either proved him sane or proved the whole universe <NUM>-witted; he saw the man of flesh approach that beautiful phantom, saw their gestures of recognition, and saw them against the sunset joining hands.

I'm a lunatic.” Then she added after a short pause, and with a sort of pride: “I've got a certificate.” Her manner, by the matchless social stoicism of her sex, was entirely suited to a drawing-room, but <PER>'s reply fell somewhat far short of such a standard, as he only said: “What the devil in hell does all this nonsense mean?” “Really,” said the young lady, and laughed. “I beg your pardon,” said the unhappy young man, rather wildly, “but what I mean is, why are you here in an asylum?” The young woman broke again into one of the maddening and mysterious laughs of femininity.",Chesterton,VirginiaWoolf,0.9843299984931946,0.9843299984931946,-0.32272952795028687
2023,"For example, the <NUM> accounts of the resurrection differ in detail, and there is no orthodox learned lawyer who dutifully accepts all <NUM> versions who could not shatter the evidence if he dealt with it in the course of his profession. These details are immaterial to the spirit of the message. It is not common sense to suppose that every item is inspired, or that we have to make no allowance for imperfect reporting, individual convictions, oriental phraseology, or faults of translation. These have, indeed, been admitted by revised versions. In His utterance about the letter and the spirit we could almost believe that Christ had foreseen the plague of texts from which we have suffered, even as He Himself suffered at the hands of the theologians of <DATE>, who then, as now, have been a curse to the world. We were meant to use our reasons and brains in adapting His teaching to the conditions of our altered lives and times. Much depended upon the society and mode of expression which belonged to His era.

To ask what is impossible from human nature is to weaken your appeal when you ask for what is reasonable. It has already been stated that of the <NUM> headings under which reforms are grouped, the exclusion of the old dispensation, the greater attention to Christ's life as compared to His death, and the new spiritual influx which is giving us psychic religion, it is only on the latter that one can quote the authority of the beyond. Here, however, the case is really understated. In regard to the Old Testament I have never seen the matter treated in a spiritual communication. The nature of Christ, however, and His teaching, have been expounded a score of times with some variation of detail, but in the main as reproduced here.

That these <NUM> so illustrious branches of the modern learning were produced for the ostensible purpose of illustrating and adorning the tyrannies which the men, under whose countenance and protection they are produced, were vainly attempting, or had vainly attempted to set bounds to or overthrow, is a fact which might seem of itself to suggest inquiry.

2030,"The whole play tells, indeed, its own story, and scarcely needs interpreting, when once the spectator has gained the true dramatic stand-point; when once he understands that there is a teacher here,--a new one,--one who will not undertake to work with the instrumentalities that his time offered to him, who begins by rejecting the abstractions which lie at the foundation of all the learning of his time, which are not scientific, but vague, loose, popular notions, that have been collected without art, or scientific rule of rejection, and are, therefore, inefficacious in nature, and unavailable for 'the art and practic part of life;' a teacher who will build up his philosophy anew, from the beginning, a teacher who will begin with history and particulars, who will abstract his definitions from nature, and have _powers_ of them, and not _words_ only, and make _them_ the basis of his science and the material and instrument of his reform. 'I will teach you _differences_,' says <PER> to the steward, alluding on the part of his author, for he does not profess to be metaphysical himself to another kind of distinction, than that which obtained in the schools; and accompanying the remark, on his own part, with some practical demonstrations, which did not appear to be taken in good part at all by the person he was at such pains to instruct in his doctrine of distinctions. The reader who has once gained this clue, the clue which the question of design and authorship involves, will find this play, as he will find, indeed, all this author's plays, overflowing every where with the scientific statement,--the finest abstract statement of that which the action, with its moving, storming, laughing, weeping, praying diagrams, sets forth in the concrete.

For it is this picture of the unaccommodated man--'unaccommodated' still, with all his empiric arts, with all his wordy philosophy--it is this picture of man '_as he is_,' in the misery of his IGNORANCE, in his blind struggle with his law of KIND, which is his law of '<ORG> unreconciled to his place in the universal order, where he must live or have no life--for the beast, obedient to his law, rejects from his kinds the _degenerate_ man--it is this vivid, condensed, scientific exhibition, this scientific collection of the fact of man as he is, in his empiric struggle with the law which universal nature enforces, and will enforce on him with all her pains and penalties till he learns it--it is this '_negation_' which brings out the true doctrine of man and human society in this method of inquiry. For the scientific method begins with negations and exclusions, and concludes only after every species of rejection; the other, the common method, which begins with 'AFFIRMATION,' is the one that has failed in practice, the one which has brought about just this state of things which science is undertaking to reform. But this _levelling_, which the man of the new science, with his new apparatus, with his 'globe and his machines,' contrives to exhibit here with so much '_facility_,' is a scientific one, designed to answer a scientific purpose merely. The experimenter, in this case, is one who looks with scientific forebodings, and not with hope only, on those storms of violent political revolution that were hanging then on the world's horizon, and threatening to repeat this process, threatening to overwhelm in their wild crash, all the ancient social structures--threatening 'to lay all flat'!

2035,"(It is sometimes, though less frequently, the case, that this disposition to make a ""joy of grief"" extends to individuals of the other sex. But in us it is even less excusable and more disgusting, because it is our nature to shun the sick and afflicted; and, unless restrained by principles other than we bring into the world with us, men might follow the example of many animals in destroying the infirm of their own species. Indeed, instances of this nature might be adduced among savage nations.) Sometimes, however, from an original _lusus naturae_, or from the influence of circumstances, a man becomes a haunter of death-beds, a tormentor of afflicted hearts, and a follower of funerals. Such an abomination now appeared before <PER>, and beckoned him into the cottage. He was considerably beyond the middle age, rather corpulent, with a broad, fat, tallow-complexioned countenance. The student obeyed his silent call, and entered the room, through the open door of which he had been gazing. He now beheld, stretched out upon the bed where she had so lately lain in life, though dying, the yet uncoffined corpse of the aged woman, whose death has been described. How frightful it seemed!--that fixed countenance of ashy paleness, amid its decorations of muslin and fine linen, as if a bride were decked for the marriage-chamber, as if death were a bridegroom, and the coffin a bridal bed. Alas that the vanity of dress should extend even to the grave! The female who, as being the near and only relative of the deceased, was supposed to stand in need of comfort, was surrounded by <NUM> or <NUM> of her own sex. These continually poured into her ear the stale, trite maxims which, where consolation is actually required, add torture insupportable to the wounded heart.

Who could have imagined that there was joy in her heart, because, since her sister's death, there was but <NUM> remaining obstacle between herself and the sole property of that wretched cottage? While <PER> stood silently observing this scene, a low, monotonous voice was uttering some words in his ear, of the meaning of which his mind did not immediately take note.

2036,"Here, too, we find ourselves coming down on all its old ceremonial and observance, from that new height which we found our foreign philosopher in such quiet possession of,--taking his way at a puff through poor <PER>'s periods,--those periods which the old orator had taken so much pains with, and laughing at his pains:--but this English philosopher is more daring still, for it is he who disposes, at a word, without any comment, just in passing merely,--from his practical stand-point,--of 'the flutes and trumpets of the Greeks,' like the other making nothing at all in his theory of criticism of _mere_ elegance, though it is the <ORG>, it is true, who undertakes the more lively and extreme practical demonstrations of this theoretical contempt of it,--setting it at nought, and flying in the face of it,--writing in as loquacious and homely a style as he possibly can, just for the purpose for setting it at nought, though not without giving us a glimpse occasionally, of a faculty that would enable him to mince the matter as fine as another if he should see occasion--as, perhaps, he may. For he talks very emphatically about his _poetry_ here and there, and seems to intimate that he has a gift that way; and that he has, moreover, some works of value in that department of letters, which he is anxious to 'save up' for posterity, if he can. But here, it is the scholar, and not the loquacious old gentleman at all, who is giving us in his choicest, selectest, courtliest phrase, in his most stately and condensed style, _his_ views of this subject; but that which is noticeable is, that _the art_ in its fresh, new upspringing from the secret of life and nature, from the soul of _things_, the art and that which it springs from, is in these <NUM> so different forms _identical_. Here, too, the point of its criticism and review is the same.

2048,"And in high quarters it was held that if, by any mode, the English fleet could be manned without resource to coercive measures, then the necessity of flogging would cease. “If we abolish either impressment or flogging, the abolition of the other will follow as a matter of course.” This was the language of the _<ORG>_, at a still later period, <DATE>. If, then, the necessity of flogging in the British armed marine was solely attributed to the impressment of the seamen, what faintest shadow of reason is there for the continuance of this barbarity in the American service, which is wholly freed from the reproach of impressment? It is true that, during a long period of non-impressment, and even down to <DATE>, flogging has been, and still is, the law of the English navy. But in things of this kind <LOC> should be nothing to us, except an example to be shunned. Nor should wise legislators wholly govern themselves by precedents, and conclude that, since scourging has so long prevailed, some virtue must reside in it. Not so. The world has arrived at a period which renders it the part of Wisdom to pay homage to the prospective precedents of the Future in preference to those of the Past. The Past is dead, and has no resurrection; but the Future is endowed with such a life, that it lives to us even in anticipation. The Past is, in many things, the foe of mankind; the Future is, in all things, our friend. In the Past is no hope; the Future is both hope and fruition. The Past is the text-book of tyrants; the Future the Bible of the Free. Those who are solely governed by the Past stand like Lot’s wife, crystallised in the act of looking backward, and forever incapable of looking before.

2052,"It shows what chance there was of any man being permitted to sustain an honourable and intelligent part in the world, in an age in which all the radical social arts were yet wanting, in which the rude institutions of an ignorant past spontaneously built up, without any science of the natural laws, were vainly seeking to curb and quench the Incarnate soul of new ages,--the spirit of a scientific human advancement; and, when all the common welfare was still openly intrusted to the unchecked caprice and passion of one selfish, pitiful, narrow, low-minded man.

2053,"Or in the discussion of a plan for reforming the king's household, and for reducing its wanton waste and extravagance--in exhibiting the detail of a plan for relieving the embarrassments of the palace just then, which, with the aid of the favourite and his friends, and _their_ measures for relief, were fast urging on the revolution--it was easy to indicate a more extensive reform; it was impossible to avoid a glance, in passing, at the pitifulness of the position of the man who held all men in awe and bondage then; it was impossible to avoid a touch of that same pen which writes elsewhere, 'Beggar and Madman,' too, so freely,--consoling _the Monarch_ with the suggestion that _Essex_ was also greatly in debt at a time when he was much sought after and caressed, and instancing the case of other courtiers who had been in the same position, and yet contrived to hold their heads up. Under the easy artistic disguise of courtly rivalries and opposing ambitions--under cover, it might be, of an outrageous personal mutual hostility--it was easy for public men belonging to the same side in politics, who were obliged to conduct, not only the business of the state, but their own private affairs, and to protect their own most sacred interests under such conditions,--it was easy for politicians trained in such a school, by the skilful use of such artifices, to play into each other's hands, and to attain ends which in open league they would have been sure to lose; to avert evils, it might be, which it would have been vain and fatal for those most concerned in them openly to resist. To give to a courtier seeking advancement, with certain ulterior aims always in view, the character of a speculator, a scholastic dreamer, unable for practice, unfit to be trusted with state affairs, was not, after all, however pointedly it might be complained of at the time, so fatal a blow as it would have been to direct attention, already sufficiently on the alert, to the remarkable practical gifts with which this same speculator happened, as we all know, to be also endowed. This courtier's chief enemy, if he had been in his great rival's secrets, or if he had reflected at all, might have done him a worse turn than that.

2055,"There can be no clear thinking, and no logical teaching until the old dispensation has been placed on the shelf of the scholar, and removed from the desk of the teacher. It is indeed a wonderful book, in parts the oldest which has come down to us, a book filled with rare knowledge, with history, with poetry, with occultism, with folklore. But it has no connection with modern conceptions of religion. In the main it is actually antagonistic to them. <NUM> contradictory codes have been circulated under <NUM> cover, and the result is dire confusion. The one is a scheme depending upon a special tribal God, intensely anthropomorphic and filled with rage, jealousy and revenge. The conception pervades every book of the Old Testament. Even in the psalms, which are perhaps the most spiritual and beautiful section, the psalmist, amid much that is noble, sings of the fearsome things which his God will do to his enemies.

There is the keynote of this ancient document--a document which advocates massacre, condones polygamy, accepts slavery, and orders the burning of so-called witches. Its Mosaic provisions have long been laid aside. We do not consider ourselves accursed if we fail to mutilate our bodies, if we eat forbidden dishes, fail to trim our beards, or wear clothes of <NUM> materials.

But, on the other hand, an immense dignity had descended upon her; she was an inhabitant of the great world, which has so few inhabitants, travelling <DATE> across an empty universe, with veils drawn before her and behind. She was more lonely than the caravan crossing the desert; she was infinitely more mysterious, moving by her own power and sustained by her own resources. The sea might give her death or some unexampled joy, and none would know of it. She was a bride going forth to her husband, a virgin unknown of men; in her vigor and purity she might be likened to all beautiful things, for as a ship she had a life of her own. Indeed if they had not been blessed in their weather, <NUM> blue day being bowled up after another, smooth, round, and flawless, Mrs. <PER> would have found it very dull.

She was working at a great design of a tropical river running through a tropical forest, where spotted deer would eventually browse upon masses of fruit, bananas, oranges, and giant pomegranates, while a troop of naked natives whirled darts into the air.

An old lady, seated in <NUM> of the comfortable rocking-chairs, rose to meet them. Her face, the visitor thought, was one of the sweetest she had ever seen. ""What a pretty girl she must have been!"" she reflected. Around her neck the old lady wore a string of gold beads, and the thick gray hair growing becomingly around her low forehead was carried back and confined in a black net. The simple charm of her welcome to the young girl was the perfection of good manners and her voice was low and pleasant. ""I'm glad you've brought my boy back, Miss <PER>, I've been missing him."" ""That's right, <PER>. Give me a good character,"" said <PER> hugging her and kissing her cheek. ""I must have waffles, though. I'm spoiled.""

My dear <PER>, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.” If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of <PER> had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown <PER> aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies.

2127,"Recollecting, however, that this portion of the road must have been passed by the angler and <PER> at too <TIME> to attract notice, he forbore to waste time by a fruitless delay. <PER> proceeded on his journey, meeting with no other noticeable event, till, arriving at the summit of a hill, he beheld, a few hundred yards before him, the Rev.

2159,"up you tumble, now, my hearties! away you go!” His gallant, off-handed, confident manner, recognising no attempt at mutiny, operated upon the sailors like magic. They _tumbled up_, as commanded; and for the rest of that night contented themselves with privately fulminating their displeasure against the Captain, and publicly emblazoning every anchor-button on the coat of admired <PER>. Captain <PER> happened to be taking a nap in his cabin at the moment of the disturbance; and it was quelled so soon that he knew nothing of it till it was officially reported to him. It was afterward rumoured through the ship that he reprimanded <PER> for acting as he did. He maintained that he should at once have summoned the marines, and charged upon the “mutineers.” But if the sayings imputed to the Captain were true, he nevertheless refrained from subsequently noticing the disturbance, or attempting to seek out and punish the ringleaders. This was but wise; for there are times when even the most potent governor must wink at transgression in order to preserve the laws inviolate for the future. And great care is to be taken, by timely management, to avert an incontestable act of mutiny, and so prevent men from being roused, by their own consciousness of transgression, into all the fury of an unbounded insurrection. _Then_ for the time, both soldiers and sailors are irresistible; as even the valour of Caesar was made to know, and the prudence of <ORG>, when their legions rebelled. And not all the concessions of <PER>, as <NUM> lord of the Admiralty, nor the threats and entreaties of <PER>, the Admiral of the Fleet—no, nor his gracious <PER>’s plenary pardon in prospective, could prevail upon the <PER> mutineers (when at last fairly lashed up to the mark) to succumb, until deserted by their own mess-mates, and a handful was left in the breach. Therefore, Mad <PER>! you did right, and no one else could have acquitted himself better. By your crafty simplicity, good-natured daring, and off-handed air (as if nothing was happening) you perhaps quelled a very serious affair in the bud, and prevented the disgrace to <ORG> of a tragical mutiny, growing out of whiskers, soap-suds, and razors.

The mind of this school is the representative mind, and all men recognise it as that, because, in its products, that nature which is in all men, which philosophy had, till then, scorned to recognise, which the abstractionists had missed in their abstractions,--that nature of will, and sense, and passion, and inanity, is brought out in its true historical proportions, not as it exists in books, not as it exists in speech, but as it exists in the actual human life.

And he added, that though it _did_ look rather unfavorable for my future prospects, to be going to sea as a common sailor so early in life; yet, it would no doubt turn out for my benefit in the end; and, at any rate, if I would only take good care of myself, would give me a sound constitution, if nothing more; and _that_ was not to be undervalued, for how many very rich men would give all their bonds and mortgages for my boyish robustness.

That is what we find in the body of the work; and the author repeats in detail what he has before made a point of telling us, in general, under this head of <ORG> of knowledge, that he sees no reason why that same instrument, which is so powerful for delusion and error, should not be restored to its true uses as an instrument of the human advancement, and a vehicle, though a veiled _one_--a beautiful and universally-welcome vehicle--for bringing in on this <ORG> the knowledges that men are most in need of.

2188,"Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at <NUM> time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.

I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood. “The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with <NUM> of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned? “I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge.

2189,"This old man sang, or rather chanted, certain words in a peculiarly long-drawn, guttural manner, throwing back his head, and turning up his sightless eyeballs to the sky. His chant was a lamentation upon his infirmity; and at the time it produced the same effect upon me, that my <NUM> reading of <ORG> to the <ORG> did, years afterward. I can not recall it all; but it was something like this, drawn out in an endless groan— “Here goes the blind old man; blind, blind, blind; no more will he see sun nor moon—no more see sun nor moon!” And thus would he pass through the middle of the street; the woman going on in advance, holding his hand, and dragging him through all obstructions; now and then leaving him standing, while she went among the crowd soliciting coppers.

The feat was unnaturally unaccountable; and he performed it with the view of attracting sympathy; since he said that in falling from a frigate’s mast-head to the deck, he had met with an injury, which had resulted in making his wonderful arm what it was. I made the acquaintance of this man, and found him no common character. He was full of marvelous adventures, and abounded in terrific stories of pirates and sea murders, and all sorts of nautical enormities. He was a monomaniac upon these subjects; he was a Newgate Calendar of the robberies and assassinations of <DATE>, happening in the sailor quarters of the town; and most of his ballads were upon kindred subjects. He composed many of his own verses, and had them printed for sale on his own account.

2192,"When it is a candidate for the chief magistracy, a candidate for the supreme power in the state, who is on his trial, of course that question as to the balance between the public and private affections, which, those who know how to trace this author's hand, know he is so fond of trying elsewhere, is sure to come up. The question is, as to whether there is any affection in this claimant for power, so large and so noble, that it can embrace heartily the common weal, and take _that_ to be _its_ good. The trial will be a sharp one. The trial of human greatness which is magnanimity, must needs be. The question is, as to whether this is a nature capable of pursuing that end for its own sake, without respect to its pivate and merely selfish recompence; whether it is one which has any such means of egress from its particular self, any such means of coming out of its private and exclusive motivity, that it can persevere in its care of the Common Weal, through good and through ill report, through personal wrong and ingratitude,--abandoning its private claim, and ascending by that conquest to the divineness. <PER>. <PER>'S ARGUING.

2197,"This Play of the Common-weal and its scientific cure, in which the question of the true <ORG> is so deeply inwrought throughout, is indeed but the filling up of that sketch of the constitution of man which we find on another page--that constitution whereby man, as man, is part and member of a common-weal--that constitution whereby his relation to the common-weal is essential to the perfection of his individual nature, and that highest good of it which is conservation with advancement--that constitution whereby the highest good of the particular and private nature, that which bids defiance to the blows of fortune, comprehends necessarily the good of the whole in its intention.

After passing <TIME>, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.

The town being the nearest mart of a large extent of back country, there are many rough farmers and woodsmen, to whom the cavalcade was an object of curiosity and admiration. The former feeling, indeed, was general throughout the village. The shop-keepers left their customers, and looked forth from the doors; the female portion of the community thrust their heads from the windows; and the people in the street formed a lane through which, with all eyes concentrated upon them, the party rode onward to the tavern.

But the commonest failing, the one which fills the spiritual hospitals of the other world, and is a temporary bar to the normal happiness of the after-life, is the sin of Tomlinson in <LOC>'s poem, the commonest of all sins in respectable British circles, the sin of conventionality, of want of conscious effort and development, of a sluggish spirituality, fatted over by a complacent mind and by the comforts of life. It is the man who is satisfied, the man who refers his salvation to some church or higher power without steady travail of his own soul, who is in deadly danger. All churches are good, Christian or non-Christian, so long as they promote the actual spirit life of the individual, but all are noxious the instant that they allow him to think that by any form of ceremony, or by any fashion of creed, he obtains the least advantage over his neighbour, or can in any way dispense with that personal effort which is the only road to the higher places. This is, of course, as applicable to believers in Spiritualism as to any other belief. If it does not show in practice then it is vain. One can get through this life very comfortably following without question in some procession with a venerable leader. But one does not die in a procession. <NUM> dies alone. And it is then that one has alone to accept the level gained by the work of life. And what is the punishment of the undeveloped soul? It is that it should be placed where it WILL develop, and sorrow would seem always to be the forcing ground of souls. That surely is our own experience in life where the insufferably complacent and unsympathetic person softens and mellows into beauty of character and charity of thought, when tried long enough and high enough in the fires of life. The Bible has talked about the ""Outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth."" The influence of the Bible has sometimes been an evil one through our own habit of reading a book of Oriental poetry and treating it as literally as if it were <ORG> prose.

Come down to the nearest decent inhabitable pub. This is a case for beer.” “I do not quite follow you,” said the <ORG>. “Yes, you do,” answered <PER>. “You follow me slap into the inn-parlour. I repeat, this is a case for beer. We must have the whole of this matter out thoroughly before we go a step farther.

2281,"When, however, they had come into the wide hollow at the bottom of that landslide, the car took a calm and graceful curve along the side of the sea, melted into the fringe of a few trees, and quietly, yet astonishingly, stopped. A belated light was burning in the broad morning in the window of a sort of lodge- or gate-keepers' cottage; and the girl stood up in the car and turned her splendid face to the sun. <PER> seemed startled by the stillness, like one who had been born amid sound and speed. He wavered on his long legs as he stood up; he pulled himself together, and the only consequence was that he trembled from head to foot. <PER> had already opened the door on his side and jumped out. The moment he had done so the strange young woman had <NUM> more mad movement, and deliberately drove the car a few yards farther. Then she got out with an almost cruel coolness and began pulling off her long gloves and almost whistling. “You can leave me here,” she said, quite casually, as if they had met <TIME> before. “That is the lodge of my father's place. Please come in, if you like--but I understood that you had some business.” <PER> looked at that lifted face and found it merely lovely; he was far too much of a fool to see that it was working with a final fatigue and that its austerity was agony. He was even fool enough to ask it a question. “Why did you save us?” he said, quite humbly. The girl tore off <NUM> of her gloves, as if she were tearing off her hand. “Oh, I don't know,” she said, bitterly. “Now I come to think of it, I can't imagine.” <PER>'s thoughts, that had been piled up to the <TIME> star, abruptly let him down with a crash into the very cellars of the emotional universe. He remained in a stunned silence for a long time; and that, if he had only known, was the wisest thing that he could possibly do at the moment. Indeed, the silence and the sunrise had their healing effect, for when the extraordinary lady spoke again, her tone was more friendly and apologetic. “I'm not really ungrateful,” she said; “it was very good of you to save me from those men.” “But why?” repeated the obstinate and dazed <ORG>, “why did you save us from the other men?",Chesterton,VirginiaWoolf,0.9840870499610901,0.9840870499610901,-0.2920117974281311

2287,"The embarrassing circumstances under which this great system of scientific practice makes its appearance in history, have not yet been taken into the account in our interpretation of it. We have already the documents which contain the theory and rule of the modern civilisation, which is the civilisation of science in our hands. We have in our hands also, newly lit, newly trimmed, lustrous with the genius of our own time, that very lamp with which we are instructed to make this inquiry, that very light which we are told we must bring to bear upon the obscurities of these documents, that very light in which we are told, we must unroll them; for they come to us, as the interpreter takes pains to tell us, with an 'infolded' science in them.

2290,"Words, words, words! 'More matter, and less art,' another says in that same treatise on art and speculation. Now inasmuch as this art and science derives all its distinction and lustre from that new light on the human estate of which it was to be the vehicle, somebody must find the trick of it, so as to be able to bring out _that doctrine_ by its help, before we can be prepared to understand the real worth of this invention. It would be premature to undertake to set it forth fully, till that is accomplished. There must be a more elaborate exhibition of that science, before the art of its transmission can be fully treated; we cannot estimate it, till we see how it strikes to the root of the new doctrine, how it begins with its beginning, and reaches to its end: we cannot estimate it till we see its relation, its essential relation, to that new doctrine of the human nature, and that new doctrine of state, which spring from the doctrine of nature in general, which is _the_ doctrine, which is the beginning and the end of the new science. We find here on the surface, as we find everywhere in this comprehensive treatise, much apparent parade of division and subdivision, and the author appears to lay much stress upon this, and seems disposed to pride himself upon his dexterity in chopping up the subject as finely as possible, and keeping the parts quite clear of one another; and sometimes, in his distributions, putting those points the farthest apart which are the most nearly related, though not so far, that they cannot 'look towards each other,' though it may be, as the other says, '_obliquely_.' He evidently depends very much on his arrangement, and seems, indeed, to be chiefly concerned about that, when he comes to the more critical parts of his subject. But it is to _the continuities_ which underlie these separations, to which he directs the attention of those to whom he speaks in earnest, and not in particular cases only. '_Generally_,' he says, '_let this be a rule_, that all partitions of knowledge be accepted rather for LINES and VEINS, than for _sections_ and _separations_, and that _the continuance and entireness of knowledge_ be preserved. For the _contrary hereof_,' he says, 'is that which has made PARTICULAR SCIENCES BARREN, SHALLOW, and ERRONEOUS, while they have not been nourished and maintained from the _common_ fountain.'

It seems very strange, but it is really true, that off <LOC> some “_sogers_” of sailors will stand cupping, and bleeding, and blistering, before they will budge. On the other hand, there are cases where a man actually sick and in need of medicine will refuse to go on the sick-list, because in that case his allowance of _grog_ must be stopped. On board of every American man-of-war, bound for sea, there is a goodly supply of wines and various delicacies put on board—according to law—for the benefit of the sick, whether officers or sailors.

Can any man be to me as <PER> was, or any woman another <PER>? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my <PER> and the conversation of <PER> will be ever whispered in my ear.

If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause. And what, <PER>, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. <DATE> will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh!

2305,"All they wanted of me was the good-will of my muscles, and the use of my backbone—comparatively small though it was at that time—by way of a lever, for the above-mentioned artists to employ when wanted. Accordingly, when any embroidery was going on in the rigging, I was set to the most inglorious avocations; as in the merchant service it is a religious maxim to keep the hands always employed at something or other, never mind what, during their watch on deck. Often furnished with a club-hammer, they swung me over the bows in a bowline, to pound the rust off the anchor: a most monotonous, and to me a most uncongenial and irksome business. There was a remarkable fatality attending the various hammers I carried over with me. Somehow they _would_ drop out of my hands into the sea. But the supply of reserved hammers seemed unlimited: also the blessings and benedictions I received from the chief mate for my clumsiness. At other times, they set me to picking oakum, like a convict, which hempen business disagreeably obtruded thoughts of halters and the gallows; or whittling belaying-pins, like a Down-Easter. However, I endeavored to bear it all like a young philosopher, and whiled away <TIME> by gazing through a port-hole while my hands were plying, and repeating Lord <PER>’s Address to the Ocean, which I had often spouted on the stage at <ORG> at home. Yes, I got used to all these matters, and took most things coolly, in the spirit of <LOC> and the stoics. All but the _“turning out”_ or rising from your berth when the watch was called at night—_that_ I never fancied. It was a sort of acquaintance, which the more I cultivated, the more I shrunk from; a thankless, miserable business, truly. Consider that after walking the deck for <TIME>, you go below to sleep: and while thus innocently employed in reposing your wearied limbs, you are started up—it seems but the next instant after closing your lids—and hurried on deck again, into the same disagreeably dark and, perhaps, stormy night, from which you descended into the forecastle. The previous interval of slumber was almost wholly lost to me; at least the golden opportunity could not be appreciated: for though it is usually deemed a comfortable thing to be asleep, yet at the time no one is conscious that he is so enjoying himself.",HermanMelville,EdgarAllanPoe,0.7814321517944336,0.7814321517944336,-3.7356252670288086

In his relief he would have believed anything. “See the poor kid,” said <PER>, catching sight of the little figure sitting out of earshot, where the twilight touched her. Mr. <PER> wheeled and strode back to the child. Her face was still hidden. “Don't cry, <PER>,” he said kindly, his voice unsteady. “She's better.” The child looked up radiantly. “I knew it!” The unexpected look and exclamation startled her grandfather. “<PER> says the doctor can't get here for a little while,” he went on, “but the mare is out of pain.” “It's all right,” rejoined the child joyously. “The doctor ought not to come. We shall do better without him.” The <NUM> gleam of her meaning began to shine across the broker's mind. He stared down at the little figure, uncertain whether to laugh or cry, sufficiently shaken to do either. “Why, you midget you,” he said, picking the child up in his arms; “have you been trying your tricks over here in the corner?” “That isn't the way to talk, grandpa, when God has helped us so,” returned <ORG> earnestly. <PER>, following his employer, had heard this colloquy, and stared open mouthed.

Look her over carefully, <PER>, carefully.” “I have.” The veterinary gave a cross look around the group, his glance resting a moment on the upturned face of a little flaxen-haired girl who stood with her hand in Mr. <PER>'s. “He's falling into his dotage, I guess,” said the doctor privately to <PER>, as he prepared to ride away. “Don't fool yourself,” returned the young fellow. “The mare pretty near scared me into a fit.

2308,"""Then this is your living self, <PER>?"" he said. The landlord extended his hand as a practical reply to the question. The stranger took it, though with no especial appearance of cordiality. ""Ay, this seems to be flesh and blood,"" he said, in the tone of one who would willingly have found it otherwise. ""And how happens this, friend <PER>? I little thought to meet you again in this life. When I last heard from you, your prayers were said, and you were bound for a better world.""

2311,"Mr. <PER>, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during <TIME>; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair. I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of <PER> stretched before me.

Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. <PER> alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses. Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?

2312,"As she spoke thus, she seemed to gaze upon some object that stood by her bedside; and the eyes of those who witnessed this scene could not but follow the direction of hers. They observed that the dying woman's own shadow was marked upon the wall, receiving a tremulous motion from the fitful rays of the lamp, and from her own convulsive efforts. ""My husband stands gazing on me,"" she said again; ""but my son,--where is he? And, as I ask, the father turns away his face. Where is our son? For his sake, I have longed to come to this land of rest. For him I have sorrowed many years. Will he not comfort me now?"" At these words the stranger made a few hasty steps towards the bed; but, ere he reached it, he conquered the impulse that drew him thither, and, shrouding his face more deeply in his cloak, returned to his former position. The dying woman, in the mean time, had thrown herself back upon the bed; and her sobbing and wailing, imaginary as was their cause, were inexpressibly affecting. ""Take me back to earth,"" she said; ""for its griefs have followed me hither."" The stranger advanced, and, seizing the lamp, knelt down by the bedside, throwing the light full upon his pale and convulsed features. ""Mother, here is your son!"" he exclaimed. At that unforgotten voice, the darkness burst away at once from her soul. She arose in bed, her eyes and her whole countenance beaming with joy, and threw her arms about his neck. A multitude of words seemed struggling for utterance; but they gave place to a low moaning sound, and then to the silence of death. The <NUM> moment of happiness, that recompensed <DATE> of sorrow, had been her last. Her son laid the lifeless form upon the pillow, and gazed with fixed eyes on his mother's face.

On beholding this natural consequence of death, the thought, perhaps, occurred to him, that her soul, no longer dependent on the imperfect means of intercourse possessed by mortals, had communed with his own, and become acquainted with all its guilt and misery.

2316,"'Lost the fruit of that opinion'--this is the author who talks so 'pressly.' <DATE> of human history are summed up in that so brief chronicle. <DATE> of barren science, of wordy speculation, of vain theory; <DATE> of blind, empirical, _unsuccessful_ groping in all the fields of human practice. 'And so,' he continues, concluding that summary criticism with a little further development of the subject, 'and _so_, turning _his opinion_ upon theology, wherewith all his natural philosophy is infected.' Natural philosophy infected with 'opinion,'--no matter whose opinion it is, or under what name it comes to us, whatever else it is good for, is not good for practice. And this is the philosophy which includes both theory and practice. 'That which in speculative philosophy corresponds to the cause, in practical philosophy becomes the rule.' But that which distinguishes this from all others is, that it is the philosophy of 'HOPE'; and that is the name for it in both its fields, in speculation _and_ practice. The black intolerable wall, which those who stopped us on the lower platform of this pyramid of true knowledge brought us up with so soon--that blank wall with which the inquiry for the physical causes in nature limits and insults our speculation--has no place here, no place at all on this higher ground of science, which the knowledge of true forms creates--this true ground of _the understanding_, the understanding of nature, and the universal reason of things. 'He who is acquainted with forms, comprehends the unity of nature in substances apparently most distinct from each other.' Neither is that base and sordid limit, with which the philosophy of physical causes shuts in the scientific arts and their power for human relief, found here.

The letter which she had received from the hands of the angler had seemed to her inexperience to prove beyond a doubt that the bearer was the friend of her father, and authorized by him, if her duty and affection were stronger than her fears, to guide her to his retreat. The letter spoke vaguely of losses and misfortunes, and of a necessity for concealment on her father's part, and secrecy on hers; and, to the credit of <PER>'s not very romantic understanding, it must be acknowledged that the mystery of the plot had nearly prevented its success. She did not, indeed, doubt that the letter was from her father's hand; for every line and stroke, and even many of its phrases, were familiar to her.

2331,"'The reason of this omission,' he supposes, 'to be that hidden rock, whereupon both this and many other barks of knowledge have been cast away, which is, that men have despised to be conversant in _ordinary and common matters_, the _judicious direction whereof, nevertheless_, is the wisest doctrine; for life consisteth not in novelties nor _subtleties_, but, _contrariwise_, they have compounded sciences _chiefly_ of _a certain_ resplendent or lustrous mass of matter, _chosen to give glory_ either to the _subtlety_ of _disputations_, or to the _eloquence_ of _discourses_.'

2338,"Nowhere, perhaps,--in his freest forms of writing, does he give a better reason, for that so deliberate and settled determination, which he so openly declares, and everywhere so stedfastly manifests, not to put himself in an antagonistic attitude towards opinions, and vocations, and professions, as they stood authorized in his time. Nowhere does he venture on a more striking comparison or simile, for the purpose of setting forth that point vividly, and impressing it on the imagination of the reader. 'The <NUM> of these is extant, and well laboured, as hath been said. The <NUM>, likewise, I may report rather dispersed than deficient; which _manner of dispersed argument I acknowledge to be best_; for who can take upon him to write of the proper duty, virtue, _challenge_ and _right_ of EVERY several vocation, profession and place? For although sometimes a looker on, may see more than a gamester, and there be a proverb more arrogant than sound, 'that the _vale_ best discovereth _the hill_,' yet there is small doubt, that men can write best, and most really and materially of their own professions,' and it is to be wished, he says, 'as that which would make learning, indeed, solid and fruitful, that active men would, or could, become writers.' And he proceeds to mention opportunely in that connection, a case very much in point, as far as he is concerned, but not on the face of it, so immediately to the purpose, as that which follows.

He ridicules, indeed, those ideal politics of antiquity as totally unfit for practical realisation, and admits that though the question as to that which is absolutely the best form of government might be of some value _in a new world_, the basis of all alterations in existing governments should be the fact, that we take a world already formed to certain customs, and do not beget it, as Pyrrha or Cadmus did theirs, and by what means soever we may have the privilege to rebuild and reform it anew, we can hardly _writhe it_ from its wonted bent, but we shall _break all_. For the subtlest principles of the philosophy of things are introduced into this discussion, and the boldest applications of the Shakspere muse are repeated in it. 'That is the way to _lay all flat_,' cries the philosophic poet in the Roman play, opposing on the part of the Conservatist, the violence of an oppressed people, struggling for new forms of government, and bringing out fully, along with their claims, the anti-revolutionary side of the question. 'That which tempts me out on these journeys,' continues this foreign philosopher, speaking in his usual ambiguous terms of his rambling excursive habits and eccentricities of proceedings, glancing also, perhaps, at his outlandish tastes--'that which tempts me out on these journeys, is _unsuitableness to the present manners of_ OUR STATE. _I_ could easily console myself with this corruption in reference to the _public interest_, but not to _my own: I_ am _in particular_ too much oppressed:--for, _in my neighbourhood_ we are of late by _the long libertinage of our civil wars grown old_ in so _riotous a form of state_, that in earnest _'tis a wonder how it can subsist_. In fine, I see by our example, that the society of men is maintained and held together _at what price soever; in what condition soever they are placed they will close and stick together_ [see the doctrine of things and their original powers in the ""Novum Organum""]--_moving and heaping up themselves, as uneven bodies, that shuffled together without order, find of themselves means to unite and settle_.",unknown,OscarWilde,0.9733440279960632,0.9733440279960632,-2.2916998863220215

My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.” “You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.” “How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.” His words had a strange effect upon me.",unknown,JaneAusten,0.7454527616500854,0.7454527616500854,-6.634129047393799
2344,"'I cannot _draw a cart_, nor _eat dried oats_,' is the officer's reply, who appears to be also in the poet's secret, and ready to aid his intention of carrying out the distinction between the human kind and the brute, 'I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;--if it be MAN'S WORK I will do it.' But it is the steward's part, as deliberately explained by <PER> himself, which furnishes in detail the ideal antagonism of that which <PER> sustains in the piece; for beside those active demonstrations of his disgust, which the poetic order tolerates in him, though some of the powers within appear to take such violent offence at it, besides these tangible demonstrations, and that elaborate criticism, which the poet puts into his mouth, in which the steward is openly treated as the representative of a class, who seem to the poet apparently, to require some treatment in his time, <PER> himself is made to notice distinctly this literally striking opposition. 'No _contraries_ hold more _antipathy_ than I, and such a knave,' he says to <LOC>, by way of explaining his apparently gratuitous attack upon the steward. No one, indeed, who reads the play with any care, can doubt the poet's intention to incorporate into it, for some reason or other, and to bring out by the strongest conceivable contrasts, his study of loyalty and service, and especially of regal counsel, and his criticism of it, as it stood in his time in its most approved patterns. 'Such smiling rouges as these' ('that _bite_ the _holy cords atwain_'). 'Smooth every _passion_ That in the _nature of their lord rebels_; Bring oil to fire, snow _to their_ colder moods; <PER>, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks With every _gale_ and _vary_ of their masters, As _knowing nought_ like _dogs_ but--_following_.'

2346,"He is one whose poetic work does not consist in illustrating these received opinions, or in finding some novel and fine expression for them. He is observing nature, and undertaking to report it, as it is, not as it should be according to these preconceptions, or according to the established poetic notions of the heroic requisitions. But there is no stage that can exhibit his experiment here in its real significance, excepting that one which he himself builds for us; for it is the vast lonely heath, and the _Man_, the pigmy man, on it--and the KING, the pigmy king, on it;--it is all the wild roar of elemental nature, and the tempest in that '_little world_ of man,' that have to measure their forces, that have to be brought into continuous and persevering contest. It is not <ORG> only, who sees in that storm what 'makes him think that _a man_ is but _a worm_.' Doubtless, it would have been more in accordance with the old poetic notions, if this poor king had maintained his ground without any misgiving at all; but it is a poet of a new order, and not the old heroic one, who has the conducting of this experiment; and though his verse is not without certain sublimities of its own, they have to consist with the report of the fact as it is, to its most honest and unpoetic, unheroic detail. And notwithstanding all the poetry of that passionate defiance, it is the physical storm that triumphs in the end. The contest between that little world of man and the great outdoor world of nature was too unequal. Compelled at last to succumb, yielding to 'the tyranny of <TIME>, that is _too rough_ for _nature to endure_--the night that frightens the very wanderers of the dark, and makes _them_ keep their caves, while it reaches, with its poetic combination of horrors, that border line of the human conception which great <ORG>'s pencil, in this Poet's hand, is always reaching and <ORG> '_Man's_ nature cannot carry The affliction nor _the fear_.' --Unable to contend any longer with 'the _fretful_ element'--unable to '_outscorn_' any longer 'the to and fro conflicting wind and rain'--weary of struggling with 'the _impetuous_ blasts,' that in their 'eyeless _rage_' and '_fury_' care no more for age and reverence than his _daughters_ do--that seize his white hairs, and make nothing of them--'exposed to _feel_ what _wretches_ feel'--he finds at last, with surprise, that art--the wretch's art--that can make vile things _precious_.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.6027476191520691,0.6027476191520691,-5.325679302215576

The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations. “I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought <PER> himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it. “As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition.

But it is high time for him to bethink himself, and 'draw his old cloak about him'; for, after all, this so just and profound a view of so grave a subject, proceeds from one who has no aims, no plan, no learning, no memory;--a vain, fantastic egotist, who writes only because he will be talking, and talking of himself above all; who is not ashamed to attribute to himself all sorts of mad inconsistent humours, and to contradict himself on every page, if thereby he can only win your eye, or startle your curiosity, and induce you to follow him.

2362,"He finds it 'in the civil streets,' 'talking plain cannon', 'humming batteries' in the most unmistakeable manner, with no particular account of its origin to give, without, indeed, appearing to recollect exactly how it came there, retaining only a general impression, that a descent from the celestial regions had, in some way, been effected during some undated period of human history, under circumstances which the memory of man was not expected to be able to recall in detail, and a certificate to that effect, divinely subscribed, was understood to be included among its properties, though it does not appear to have been, on the face of it, so absolutely conclusive as to render a little logical demonstration, on the part of royalty itself, superfluous. It was not very far from this time, that a very able and loyal servant of the crown undertook, openly, to assist the royal memory on this delicate point; and, though the details of that historical representation, and the manner of it, are, of course, quite different from those of the Play, it will be found, upon careful examination, not so dissimilar in purport as the exterior would have seemed to imply. The philosopher does not feel called upon, in either case, to begin by contradicting flatly, in so many words, the theory which he finds the received one on that point. Even the _poet_, with all his freedom, is compelled to go to work after another fashion. 'And _thus_ do we, of wisdom, and of reach, With _windlasses_, and with <ORG> of BIAS, By indirections find directions out.' He has his own way of creating an historical retrospect. No one need know that it _is_ a retrospect; no one will know it, perhaps, who has not taken the author's clue elsewhere. The crisis is already reached when the play begins. The collision between the civil want and the military government is at its height. It is a revolution on which the curtain rises. It is a city street filled with dark, angry swarms of men, who have come forth to seek out this government, in the person of its chief, who stop only to conduct their summary trial of it, and then hurry on to execute their verdict. But the poet arrests this revolution. Before we proceed any further, 'Hear _me_ speak,' he cries, through the lips of the plebeian leader.

2365,"“You mean to say that we----” “I mean to say the plain truth now that the danger is over,” said <PER>, calmly; “most certainly you <NUM> were the only people he ever was afraid of.” Then he added in a low but not inaudible voice: “Except one--whom he feared worse, and has buried deeper.” “Come away,” cried <ORG>, “this has to be thought about.” <PER> followed him in silence as he strode away, but just before he vanished, turned and spoke again to the doctors. “But what has got hold of people?” he asked, abruptly. “Why should all <LOC> have gone dotty on the mere subject of dottiness?” Dr. <PER> smiled his open smile once more and bowed slightly. “As to that also,” he replied, “I don't want to make you vain.” <PER> swung round without a word, and he and his companion were lost in the lustrous leafage of the garden. They noticed nothing special about the scene, except that the garden seemed more exquisite than ever in the deepening sunset, and that there seemed to be many more people, whether patients or attendants, walking about in it. From behind the <NUM> black-coated doctors as they stood on the lawn another figure somewhat similarly dressed strode hurriedly past them, having also grizzled hair and an open flapping frock-coat. Both his decisive step and dapper black array marked him out as another medical man, or at least a man in authority, and as he passed <PER> the latter was aroused by a strong impression of having seen the man somewhere before. It was no one that he knew well, yet he was certain that it was someone at whom he had at sometime or other looked steadily. It was neither the face of a friend nor of an enemy; it aroused neither irritation nor tenderness, yet it was a face which had for some reason been of great importance in his life. Turning and returning, and making detours about the garden, he managed to study the man's face again and again--a moustached, somewhat military face with a monocle, the sort of face that is aristocratic without being distinguished. <PER> could not remember any particular doctors in his decidedly healthy existence. Was the man a long-lost uncle, or was he only somebody who had sat opposite him regularly in a railway train? At that moment the man knocked down his own eye-glass with a gesture of annoyance; <PER> remembered the gesture, and the truth sprang up solid in front of him.",Chesterton,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9890974760055542,0.9890974760055542,-1.1423664093017578
2366,"Well, I will not look into it,” she returned decidedly; “and if Dr. <PER> were not the broad, noble type of man that he is, he wouldn't take the trouble to notice and entertain a child who has treated him as she has. It might touch even you to see the lengths to which he goes to please you. I hope you will at least have the grace to go down with <ORG> to the buggy and see them off.” “I couldn't in this wrapper,” replied <PER>, releasing the speaker. “Of course not, so put on a dress before you go up to <LOC>.” “It's too late, dear. He'll be here by <DATE>. I must have her ready.” Mrs. <PER> looked after her daughter's retreating figure, and then her lips came together firmly. She untied the ribbons of the loose gown of lace and silk, in which she had keyed herself up by degrees to face the requirements of luncheon and the <TIME>'s diversions, and donned a conventional dress, in which she composed herself by the window to watch for the doctor's buggy. There was a vista in the park avenue which afforded a fair look at equipages <TIME> before they could reach Mr. <PER>'s gateway. From the moment the doctor's office hour was over this stanch supporter set herself to watch that gap. As soon as she saw <PER>'s dappled coat and easy stride she sprang up and went downstairs, and when the shining buggy paused at the steps and Dr. <PER> jumped out, she appeared on the piazza to greet him. “What an inspiring morning!” she said, as he removed his hat. “That insane girl!” she thought. “If he had chanced to be awkward and plain, he would have been just as important to us. His good looks are thrown in, and yet she won't behave herself.” “Glorious indeed!” he replied heartily. “Where's my young lady?” Mrs. <PER> had plenty of worldly experience, and not even her enemies called her stupid, but at this moment there was but <NUM> young lady in the world to her, as she believed there was to him. “She is upstairs braiding <ORG>'s hair,” she replied before she realized her own insanity. Then she hastened on, coloring under the odd look in his eyes, “But you mean <PER>, of course. She will be down at once, I'm sure. It's so kind of you to take her.” “Not at all. She's an original worth cultivating.” Mrs. <PER> shrugged her shoulders.",unknown,VirginiaWoolf,0.9817551374435425,0.9817551374435425,-0.7808210849761963
2367,"She was not sure of this logic. “So now we're perfectly square,” went on the doctor, “but don't you fall ill again.” He shook his head at her. “I want us to remain friends.” “We'd always be friends, wouldn't we?” returned <ORG>, smiling into his laughing eyes. “When is our golf coming off, Miss <PER>?” he asked, looking across the table again. “When the weather permits,” she responded graciously. “I guess that's going to be all right,” commented Mrs. <PER> mentally. “She's as pretty as a painting with that rose on, and her mother looks as contented as a cat with her paw on a mouse. She don't mean to play with that mouse, either. She won't run any risks. She'll take it right in. You're pretty near done for, my young feller, and your eyes look willing, I must say.” The spring rain proved to be a protracted storm. Mr. <PER> made his <TIME> long in the city. <PER> came up to <ORG>'s room each morning and read the lesson with her, always reading on to herself after it was finished. She made the child tell her of the circumstances of her recent illness and cure, and listened to <ORG>'s affectionate comments on Dr. <PER>'s kindness with an inscrutable expression which did not satisfy the child. “You love him, don't you?” asked the little girl. <PER> gave a slight smile. “If everything that isn't love is hate, I suppose I ought to,” she returned. “Yes, indeed,” agreed <PER>; “and he has been so kind to you I don't see how you can help it.” The girl sighed. “Don't grow up, <PER>,” she said. “It makes lots of trouble.” On the <NUM> <NUM> of her visits to the child's room she put her hand on the flaxen head. “I'd like to fix your hair,” she said. “Mrs. <PER> doesn't part it nicely.” “I do it myself,” returned <ORG>; “but I'd be glad to have you.” So <PER> washed the thick flaxen locks and dried them. Then she parted and brushed the hair, and when it was finally tied, <PER> regarded the reflection of her smooth head with satisfaction. “It looks just the way mother makes it,” she said.",unknown,VirginiaWoolf,0.9736377596855164,0.9736377596855164,-1.3244068622589111
2369,"He will make over to the ignominy of ignorant and barbaric ages,--'for we call a nettle but a nettle,' he will turn into a forgotten pageant of the rude, early, instinctive ages, the yet brutal ages of an undeveloped humanity, that triumphant reception at home, of <ORG>. He will undermine, in all the states, the ethics and religion of brute force, till men shall grow sick, at last, of the old, rusty, bygone trumpery of its insignia, and say, 'Take away those baubles.' But the hero that we deal with here, is but the pure negation of that heroism which his author conceives of, aspires to, and will have, historical, which he defines as the pattern of man's nature in all men. This one knows no _common_-wealth; the wealth that is wealth in his eyes, is all his own; the weal that he conceives of, is the weal that is warm at his own heart only. At best he can go out of his particular only as far as the limits of his own hearthstone, or the limits of his clique or caste. And in his selfish passion, when that demands it, he will sacrifice the nearest to him. As to the <ORG>, they are 'but things to buy and sell with groats,' a herd, a mass, a machine, to be informed with his single will, to be subordinated to his single wishes; in peace enduring the gnawings of hunger, that the garners their toil has filled may overflow for him,--enduring the badges of a degradation which blots out the essential humanity in them, to feed his pride;--in war offered up in droves, to win the garland of the war for him. That is the old hero's commonwealth. His small brain, his brutish head, could conceive no other. The ages in which he ruled the world with his instincts, with his fox-like cunning, with his wolfish fury, with his dog-like ravening,--those brute ages could know no other. But it is the sturdy European race that the hero has to deal with here; and though, in the moment of victory, it is ready always to chain itself to the conqueror's car, and, in the exultation of conquest, and love for the conqueror, fastens on itself, with joy, the fetters of ages, this quarrel is always breaking out in it anew: it does not like being governed with the edge of the sword;--it is not fond of martial law as a permanent institution.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.9861452579498291,0.9861452579498291,-2.526888370513916
2373,"That form which 'lies there,' with its mute eloquence speaking this Poet's word, is what he calls 'a Transient Hieroglyphic,' which makes, he says, 'a deeper impression on minds of a certain order, than the language of arbitrary signs;' and his 'delivery' on the most important questions will be found, upon examination, to derive its principal emphasis from a running text in this hand. '_For_, in such business,' he says, '_action_ is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant more _learned_ than the ears.' Or, as he puts it in another place: 'What is sensible always strikes the memory more strongly, and sooner _impresses_ itself, than what is intellectual. Thus the memory of _brutes_ is excited by sensible, but not by intellectual things. And therefore it is easier to retain the image of a _sportsman hunting_, than of the corresponding notion of _invention_--of an apothecary ranging his boxes, than of the corresponding notion of _disposition_--of an orator making a speech, than of the term Eloquence--or _a boy repeating verses_, than the term _Memory_--_or_ of A <ORG> acting his part, than the corresponding notion of--ACTION.' So, also, '_<PER> <PER>_' was a better word for 'houseless misery,' than all the king's prayer, good as it was, about 'houseless heads, and unfed sides,' in general, and 'looped, and windowed raggedness.' 'We construct,' says this author, in another place--rejecting the ordinary history as not suitable for scientific purposes, because it is 'varied, and diffusive, and confounds and disturbs the understanding, unless it be fixed and exhibited in due order'--we construct 'tables and _combinations_ of _instances_, upon such a plan and in such order, that the understanding be enabled to act upon them.'

2374,"I'm sure he will call to-night.” CHAPTER X THE RAVINE Outside the well-kept roads of Bel-Air Park, <ORG> had been encouraged to work her sweet will. The drive wound along the edge of a picturesque gorge, and it was not long before <ORG> found the scene of her father's favorite stories. The sides of the ravine were studded with tall trees, and in its depths flowed a brook, unusually full now from the spring rains. The child lost no time in creeping beneath the slender wire fence at the roadside, and scrambling down the incline. The brook whispered and gurgled, wild flowers sprang amid the ferns in the shelter and moisture. The child was enraptured. “Oh, <PER>!” She exclaimed, hugging the doll for pure joy. “<ORG> is far away. There's nobody down here but God!” For <TIME> she played happily in the enchanting spot, all unconscious of time. <PER> lay on a bed of moss, while <ORG> became acquainted with her wonderful new playmate, the brook. The only body of water with which she had been familiar hitherto was <LOC>. Now she drew stones out of the bank and made dams and waterfalls. She sailed boats of chips and watched them shoot the tiny rapids. She lay down on the bank beside <PER> and gazed up through the leafy treetops. Many times this programme had been varied, when at last equipages began to pass on the road above. She could see twinkling wheels and smart liveries. With a start of recollection, she considered that she might have been a long time in the ravine. “I wish somebody would let me bring a watch the next time,” she said to her doll, as she took her up. “Haven't we had a beautiful afternoon, <PER>? Let's call it the Ravine of Happiness, and we'll come here every day--just every day; but perhaps it's time for grandpa to be home, <PER>, so we must go back to the castle.” She sighed unconsciously as she began climbing up the steep bank and crept under the wire. “I hope we haven't stayed very long, because the giantess might not like it,” she continued uneasily; but as she set her feet in the homeward road, every sensation of anxiety fled before an approaching vision. She saw a handsome man in riding dress mounted on a shining horse with arched neck, that lifted its feet daintily as it pranced along the tree-lined avenue. “<PER>!” ejaculated <ORG>, stepping to the roadside and pausing, her hands clasped beneath her chin and her eyes shining with admiration.",unknown,MarkTwain,0.980658769607544,0.980658769607544,-1.5126787424087524
2378,"If they only won't break the flowers she won't care,” returned the child, entering into the fancy with zest. Mr. <PER> took the doll from her arms, and carrying it up the steps deposited it in the piazza chair. “Isn't she going?” asked <ORG> soberly. “No, not this time. She doesn't care, she's been there so much. Just see how cheerful and comfortable she looks!” There was, indeed, a smile of almost cloying sweetness on <PER> countenance, and she seemed to be seeing pleasing visions. “I never saw such a good child!” said <PER> with an admiring sigh; then she put her hand in her grandfather's and they strolled out into the park and up the shady road. Just before reaching the bend around which lay the gorge, Mr. <PER> surprised his companion by breaking in upon her lively chatter with a tune which he whistled loudly. It was such an unusual ebullition that <ORG> looked up at him. “Why, grandpa, I never heard you whistle before,” she said. “You didn't? That's because you never before saw me out on a lark. I tell you, I'm a gay one when I get started,” and forthwith there burst again from his lips a gay refrain, that sounded shrilly up the leafy path. They rounded the bend in the road, and the broker looked down into the eyes that were bent upon him in admiration. “You whistle almost as well as Mr. <PER>,” said the child. “Give me time and I dare say I shall beat him out,” was the swaggering response. “Ah, here's your ravine, is it?” “Yes, that's”--began <LOC>, and went no further. A couple of rods from where she suddenly came to a standstill was an object which for a moment rooted her to the spot. A small horse, black as jet, with a white star in his forehead and a flowing, wavy mane and tail, stood by the roadside. His coat, gleaming like satin, set off the pure white leather of his trappings. On his back was fastened a side saddle, and he was tethered to the rail of the light fence. Mr. <PER> appeared not to see him. He was looking down the rocks and grass of the steep incline. “Is there any sort of a path?” he asked, “or do you descend it as you would a cellar door?",unknown,ArthurConanDoyle,0.6561610102653503,0.6561610102653503,-4.794700622558594
2379,"'Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, Hang up philosophy'-- wrote this Poet's fire of old. 'Canst thou not minister to a _mind_ diseased?' it writes again. No? 'Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it.' 'See now what _learning_ is,' says the practical-minded nurse, quite dazzled and overawed with that exhibition of it which has just been brought within her reach, and expressing, in the readiest and largest terms which her vocabulary supplies to her, her admiration of the practical bent of <PER> genius; who seems to be doing his best to illustrate the idea which another student, who was not _a Friar_ exactly, was undertaking to demonstrate from his cell about that time--the idea of the possibility of converging a large and studious observation of nature in general,--and it is a very large and curious one which _this Friar_ betrays,--upon any of those ordinary questions of domestic life, which are constantly recurring for private solution. And though _this_ knowledge might seem to be 'so variable as it falleth not under _precept_,' the prose philosopher is of the opinion that 'a universal insight, and a wisdom of council and advice, gathered by general observation of cases of _like nature_,' is available for the particular instances which occur in this department. And the philosophic poet appears to be of his opinion; for there is no end to the precepts which he inducts from this 'variable knowledge' when he gets it on his table of review, in the form of natural history, in '_prerogative cases_' and 'illustrious instances,' cases cleared from their accidental and extraneous adjuncts--ideal cases. And though this poor Friar does not appear to have been very successful in this particular instance; if we take into account the fact that 'the Tragedy was the thing,' and that nothing but a tragedy would serve his purpose, and that all his learning was converged on that _effect_; if we take into account the fact that this is a scientific experiment, and that the characters are sacrificed for the sake of the useful conclusions, the success will not perhaps appear so questionable as to throw any discredit upon this new theory of the applicability of _learning_ to questions of this nature.

2380,"Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor. His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of <PER> and <ORG>, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence! I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from <PER> the particulars of his creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable. “Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.” <PER> discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.” Thus has <DATE> passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys <NUM> comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9771646857261658,0.9771646857261658,-2.2632181644439697
2381,"The author of the Novum <PER> orders and initiates this inquiry; but the basis of the induction in this department is as yet wanting; and the collections and experiments here require combinations of skill and labour which they cannot at once command. They will do what they can here too, in their small way, just to make a beginning; but they do not lay much stress upon any thing they can accomplish with the use of their own method in this field. It serves, however, a very convenient purpose with them; neither do they at all underrate its intrinsic importance. But the man who has studiously created for himself a social position which enables him to assume openly, and even ostentatiously, the position of an innovator--an innovator _in the world of letters_, an advancer of--_learning_--is compelled to introduce his innovation with the complaint that he finds the mind of the world so stupified, so bewildered with evil, and so under the influence of dogmas, that the <NUM> thing to be done is to get so much as a thought admitted of the possibility of a better state of things. 'The present system of philosophy,' he says, 'cherishes in its bosom certain positions or dogmas which it will be found, are calculated to produce a full conviction that no difficult, commanding, and powerful operation on nature _ought_ to be anticipated, through the means of art.' And, therefore, after criticising the theory and practice of the world as he finds it, reporting as well as he can,--though he can find no words, he says, in which to do justice to his feeling in regard to it--_the deficiencies_ in its learning, he devotes a considerable portion of the description of his new method to the grounds of 'hope' which he derives from this philosophic survey, and that that hope is not a hope of a better state of things in respect to the physical wants of man merely, that it is not a hope of a renovation in the arts which minister to those wants exclusively, any very careful reader of the <NUM> book of the Novum Organum will be apt on the whole to infer. But the statements here are very general, and he refers us to another place _for particulars_.

Here in this Art of Tradition, which comprehends the whole subject of the human speech from the new ground of the common nature in man--that _double_ nature which tends to isolation on the one hand, and which makes him a part and a member of society on the other; we find it treated, <NUM>, as a means by which men come simply to a common understanding with each other, by which that _common ground_, that ground of _community_, and _communication_, and _identity_, which a common _understanding_ in this kind makes, can be best reached; and next we find it treated as a means by which _more than the understanding_ shall be reached, by which _the sentiment_, the _common sentiment_, which also belongs to the larger nature, shall be strengthened and developed,--by which the counteracting and partial sentiments shall be put in their place, and the _will_ compelled; whereby that common human form, which in its perfection is the object of the human love and reverence shall be scientifically developed; by which the particular form with its diseases shall be artistically disciplined and treated. This Art of Tradition concerns, <NUM>, the understanding; and <NUM>, the affections and the will. As man is constituted, it is not enough to convince his understanding. <NUM>, then, it is 'the organ' and 'method' of tradition; and next, it is what he calls the _illustration_ of it. <NUM>, the object is, to bring truth to the understanding in as clear and unobstructed a manner as the previous condition--as the diseases and pre-occupations of the mind addressed will admit of, and next to bring all the other helps and arts by which the sentiments are touched and the will mastered. <NUM>, he will speak true, or as true as they will let him; but it is not enough to speak true.

2390,"And as he makes, too, the claim that he has himself given practical proof, in passing, of his proficiency in this art, and appeals to the skilful for the truth of this statement, the passage, at least, in which this assertion is made, will be likely to repay the inquiry which it invites. He begins by drawing our attention to the fact, that words are not the only representatives of things, and he says 'this is not an inconsiderable thing, _for while we are treating of the coin of intellectual_ matters, _it is_ pertinent to observe, that as money may be made of other materials besides gold and silver, so other marks of things may be invented besides words and letters.' And by way of illustrating the advantages of such a means of tradition, under certain disadvantages of position, he adduces as much in point, the case of Periander, who being consulted how to preserve a tyranny _newly usurped_, bid the messenger _attend_ and _report what he saw him do_, and went into his garden and _topped all the highest flowers_; signifying that it consisted in the cutting off and keeping low of the nobility and grandees. And thus other apparently trivial, purely purposeless and sportive actions, might have a traditionary character of no small consequence, if the messenger were only given to understand beforehand, that the acts thus performed were axiomatical, pointing to rules of practice, that the forms were representative forms, whose '_real_' exhibition of the particular natures in question, was much more vivid and effective, much more memorable as well as _safe_, than any abstract statement of that philosophic truth, which is the truth of direction, could be. As to the '_accidents_ of words, which are measure, sound, and elevation of accent, and the sweetness and harshness of them,' even here the new science suggests a new rule, which is not without a remarkable relation to _that 'particular method of tradition_,' which the author tells us in another place, some parts of his new science required. 'This subject,' he says, 'involves some curious observations in rhetoric, but chiefly <ORG>, as we consider it in respect of the verse, and _not of the argument_; wherein, though men in learned tongues do tie themselves to _the ancient measures_, yet in modern languages it seemeth to me as free to make _new measures of verses as of dances_.'",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9799465537071228,0.9799465537071228,-0.6622191667556763

2396,"I’d have died <NUM>!” To <PER>’s great relief, the store ship at last moved further up the bay, and it fortunately happened that he saw no more of his brother while in <LOC>; and while there, he never in any way made himself known to him. CHAPTER LX. A MAN-OF-WAR’S-MAN SHOT AT. There was a seaman belonging to the fore-top—a mess-mate, though not a top-mate of mine, and no favourite of the Captain’s,—who, for certain venial transgressions, had been prohibited from going ashore on liberty when the ship’s company went. Enraged at the deprivation—for he had not touched earth in upward of <DATE>—he, <DATE> after, lowered himself overboard, with the view of gaining a canoe, attached by a rope to a Dutch galiot some cables’-lengths distant. In this canoe he proposed paddling himself ashore. Not being a very expert swimmer, the commotion he made in the water attracted the ear of the sentry on that side of the ship, who, turning about in his walk, perceived the faint white spot where the fugitive was swimming in the frigate’s shadow. He hailed it; but no reply. “Give the word, or I fire!” Not a word was heard. The next instant there was a red flash, and, before it had completely ceased illuminating <TIME> the white spot was changed into crimson. Some of the officers, returning from a party at <LOC> the Flamingoes, happened to be drawing near the ship in one of her cutters. They saw the flash, and the bounding body it revealed. In a moment the topman was dragged into the boat, a handkerchief was used for a tourniquet, and the wounded fugitive was soon on board the frigate, when, the surgeon being called, the necessary attentions were rendered. Now, it appeared, that at the moment the sentry fired, the top-man—in order to elude discovery, by manifesting the completest quietude—was floating on the water, straight and horizontal, as if reposing on a bed. As he was not far from the ship at the time, and the sentry was considerably elevated above him—pacing his platform, on a level with the upper part of the hammock-nettings—the ball struck with great force, with a downward obliquity, entering the right thigh just above the knee, and, penetrating some inches, glanced upward along the bone, burying itself somewhere, so that it could not be felt by outward manipulation.",HermanMelville,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9833137392997742,0.9833137392997742,-0.5680879354476929

The unexpected reply was startling. “What are you talking about?” asked Mrs. <PER>. “Oh, I'm so tired of it all,” replied the girl wearily. A frown contracted her mother's forehead. “Tired of what? Turn around here!” She rose and put her hands on the pretty shoulders and turned her child until the clear gray eyes met hers. “Now then, tired of what?” <PER> smiled slightly, and sighed. “Of playing nocturnes to Dr. <PER>.” “And he is quite as tired of hearing you, I dare say,” was the retort. “It seems to me you always stumble when you play to the doctor, and he adores <PER>.” <PER> continued to meet her mother's annoyed gaze, her hands fallen in her lap, all the lines of her nut-brown hair, her exquisite face, and pliable, graceful figure so many silent arguments, as they always were, against any one's harboring annoyance toward her. “You say he does, mother, and you have assured him of it so often that the poor man doesn't dare to say otherwise; but really, if you'd let him have the latest <PER> and Field hit, I think he would be so grateful.” “Learn it then!” returned Mrs. <PER>. <PER> laughed lazily. “<ORG> little mother!” Then she added, in a different tone, “Don't you think there is any danger of our being too obliging?

2399,"They are like the sheaths with which she hides through frost and wind and shower, until <TIME> has come, her vernal patterns, her secret toils, her magic cunning, her struggling aspirations, her glorious successes, her celestial triumphs. In the midst of this studious fog of scholasticism, this complicated network of superficial divisions, the man of humour, who is always not far off and ready to assist in the priestly ministrations as he sees occasion, gently directs our attention to those more simple and natural divisions of the subject, and those more immediately practical terms, which it might be possible to use, under certain circumstances, in speaking of the _same subjects_, into which, however, _these_ are easily resolvable, as soon as the right point of observation is taken. Through all this haze, he contrives to show us confidentially, the outline of those grand natural divisions, which he has already clearly produced--under their scholastic names, indeed,--in his book of the Advancement of Learning; but which he cannot so openly continue, in a work produced professedly, as a practical instrument fit for application to immediate use, and where the true application is constantly entering the vitals of subjects too delicate to be openly glanced at then. But he gives us to understand, however, that he _has_ made the application of this method to practice, in a much more _specific, detailed_ manner, in another place, that he _has_ brought it down from those more general forms of the Novum Organum, into 'the nobler' departments, 'the more chosen' departments of that universal field of human practice, which the Novum Organum takes up in its great outline, and boldly and clearly claims in the general, though when it comes to specific applications and particulars, it does so stedfastly strike, or appear to strike, into that one track of practice, which was the only one left open to it then,--which it keeps still as rigidly as if it had no other. He has brought it out, he tells us, from that trunk of 'universality,' and carried it with his own hand into the minutest points and fibres of particulars, those points and fibres, those living articulations in which the grand natural divisions he indicates here, naturally terminate; the divisions which the philosopher who 'makes the Art and Practic part of life, the _mistress_ to his <LOC>,' must of course follow.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.984961986541748,0.984961986541748,-0.3837907016277313

2410,"His relation to the new intellectual development of his age might, perhaps, be characterised as _Socratic_; though certainly not because he lacked the use, and the most masterly use, of that same weapon with which his younger contemporary brought out at last, in the face of his time, the plan of the Great Instauration. In the heart of the new establishment which the magnificent courtier, who was a 'Queen's delight,' must now maintain, there soon came to be a little 'Academe.' The choicest youth of the time, 'the Spirits of the Morning Sort,' gathered about him. It was the new philosophic and poetic genius of the age that he attracted to him; it was on that philosophic and poetic genius that he left his mark for ever. He taught them, as the masters taught of old, in dialogues--in words that could not then be written, in words that needed the master's modulation to give them their significance. For the new doctrine had need to be clothed in a language of its own, whose inner meaning only those who had found their way to its inmost shrine were able to interpret. We find some contemporary and traditional references to this school, which are not without their interest and historical value, as tending to show the amount of influence which it was supposed to have exerted on the time, as well as the acknowledged necessity for concealment in the studies pursued in it. The fact that such an <ORG> _existed_, that it _began with <ORG>_, that young men of distinction were attracted to it, and that in such numbers, and under such conditions, that it came to be considered ultimately as a '_School_,' of which he was the head-master--the fact that the new experimental science was supposed to have had its origin in this association,--that opinions, differing from the received ones, were also secretly discussed in it,--that _anagrams_ and other devices were made use of for the purpose of infolding the _esoteric_ doctrines of the school in popular language, so that it was possible to write in this language acceptably to the vulgar, and without violating preconceived opinions, and at the same time instructively to the initiated,--all this remains, even on the surface of statements already accessible to any scholar,--all this remains, either in the form of contemporary documents, or in the recollections of persons who have apparently had it from the most authentic sources, from persons who profess to know, and who were at least in a position to know, that such was the impression at the time.",unknown,OscarWilde,0.6404139995574951,0.6404139995574951,-6.070572853088379
2411,"...This is an art Which does _mend nature_, _change_ it rather: but _The art itself_ is nature.' That is the Poet's view, but the Philosopher is of the same opinion. 'Man while _operating_ can only _apply or withdraw_ natural bodies, nature internally _performs_ the rest.' Those who become _practically_ versed in nature are the mechanic, the mathematician, the <PER>, and _the magician_, but _all_, as matters now stand with faint efforts and meagre success.'... 'The syllogism forces _assent_ and not _things_.' '_The subtlety of nature is far beyond that of sense or of the understanding._ The syllogism consists of propositions, these of words, words are the signs of notions, notions represent things. If our notions are fantastical, the whole structure falls to the ground; but they are for the most part improperly abstracted and deduced from _things_.' There is the whole of it; there it is in a nut-shell. As we are very apt to find it in this method of delivery by aphorisms; there is the shell of it at least. And considering 'the torture and press of the method,' and the instruments of torture then in use for correcting the press, on these precise questions, there is as much of the kernel, perhaps, as could reasonably be looked for, in those particular aphorisms; and 'aphorisms representing a _knowledge broken_, do _invite_ men to inquire further;' so _this_ writer of them tells us. With all his reliance on nature then, and with all his scorn of the impracticable and arrogant conceits of learning as he finds it, and of the quackeries that are practised in its name, this is no empiric. He will not approach that large, complex, elaborate combination of nature, that laboured fruit of time,--her most subtle and efficacious agent, so prolific in results that amaze and confound our art, --he will not approach this great structure with all its unperceived interior adaptations,--with so much of nature's own work in it, --hehas too much respect for her own 'cunning hand,' to approach it without learning,--to undertake its cure with blind ignorant experiments. He will not go to work in the dark on this structure, with drug or surgery. This is going to be a scientific cure. 'Before we proceed any further, _hear me speak_.' He will inquire beforehand the nature of this particular structure that he proposes to meddle with, and get its normal state defined at the outset.

2418,"Whatever our 'perfect example in civil life' may be, and we are, perhaps, not likely to get it openly in the form of an historic '_composition_' on this author's stage, whatever name and shape it may take when it comes, this evidently is not it.

For it is a treatment which throws in passing, the shadow of the old metaphysical suspicion and scepticism on that chaotic unaxiomatical condition of things which the scientific eye discovers here, for the new philosophy with all its new comprehension of the actual, with all its new convergency on practice, is careful to inform us that it observes, notwithstanding the old distinction between 'being and becoming.' This is an <ORG> philosophy also, though the notions of nature are more respected in it, than the spontaneous unconsidered notions of men.

2420,"Above all, shedding down His atmosphere upon all, broods that great Christ spirit, the very soul of reason, of justice, and of sympathetic understanding, who has the earth sphere, with all its circles, under His very special care. It is a place of joy and laughter. There are games and sports of all sorts, though none which cause pain to lower life. Food and drink in the grosser sense do not exist, but there seem to be pleasures of taste, and this distinction causes some confusion in the messages upon the point. But above all, brain, energy, character, driving power, if exerted for good, makes a man a leader there as here, while unselfishness, patience and spirituality there, as here, qualify the soul for the higher places, which have often been won by those very tribulations down here which seem so purposeless and so cruel, and are in truth our chances of spiritual quickening and promotion, without which life would have been barren and without profit. The revelation abolishes the idea of a grotesque hell and of a fantastic heaven, while it substitutes the conception of a gradual rise in the scale of existence without any monstrous change which would turn us in an instant from man to angel or devil. The system, though different from previous ideas, does not, as it seems to me, run counter in any radical fashion to the old beliefs. In ancient maps it was usual for the cartographer to mark blank spaces for the unexplored regions, with some such legend as ""here are anthropophagi,"" or ""here are mandrakes,"" scrawled across them. So in our theology there have been ill-defined areas which have admittedly been left unfilled, for what sane man has ever believed in such a heaven as is depicted in our hymn books, a land of musical idleness and barren monotonous adoration! Thus in furnishing a clearer conception this new system has nothing to supplant. It paints upon a blank sheet. <NUM> may well ask, however, granting that there is evidence for such a life and such a world as has been described, what about those who have not merited such a destination? What do the messages from beyond say about these? And here one cannot be too definite, for there is no use exchanging <NUM> dogma for another. One can but give the general purport of such information as has been vouchsafed to us.

But, this in connection with the preceding inquiry in regard to the effect of titles on the progress of a fever, or the amenability of its paroxysm, to flexure and low bending, might have seemed perhaps in the mouth of a subject to savour somewhat of irony; it might have sounded too much like a taunt upon the royal helplessness under cover of a serious philosophical inquiry, or it might have betrayed in such an one a disposition to pursue scientific inquiries farther than was perhaps expedient.

'Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,' he adds, 'and tell me truly what thou think'st of him.'

It was an enterprise in which the intense motivity of that new and so 'conspicuous' development of the particular and private nature, which lies at the root of such a genius, was sustained by the determination of that not less superior development of the nobler nature in man, by the motivity of the intellect, by the sentiment which waits on _that_, by the motive of 'the larger whole,' which is, in this science of it, 'the worthier.' We do not need to apply the key of times to those indirectly historical remains in which the real history, the life and soul of a time, is always best found, and in which the history of such a time, if written at all, must necessarily be inclosed; we do not need to unlock these works to perceive the indications of suppressed movements in that age, in which the most illustrious men of the age were primarily concerned, the history of which has not yet fully transpired.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9476214051246643,0.9476214051246643,-1.8140922784805298

It is easy to see, however, what extraordinary capabilities this particular form of writing offered to one who _had_ any purpose, or to an author, who wished on any account, to '_infold_' somewhat his meaning;--that was the term used then in reference to this style of writing. For certainly, many things dangerous in themselves could be shuffled in under cover of an artistic effect, which would not strike at the time, amid the agitations, and the skilful checks, and counteractions, of the scene, even the quick ear of despotism itself. And thus <PER>--that impersonation of absolutism--the very embodiment of pure will and tyranny in their most frantic form, taken out all at once from that hot bath of flatteries to which he had been so long accustomed, that his whole self-consciousness had become saturated, tinctured in the grain with them, and he believed himself to be, within and without, indestructibly, essentially,--'ay, every inch A KING;' with speeches on his supremacy copied, well nigh verbatim, from those which <PER>'s courtiers habitually addressed to her, still ringing in his ears, hurled out into a single-handed contest with the elements, stripped of all his 'social and artificial lendings,' the poor, bare, unaccommodated, individual man, this living subject of the poet's artistic treatment,--this 'ruined <PER>' anatomized alive, taken to pieces literally before our eyes, pursued, hunted down scientifically, and robbed in detail of all 'the additions of a <MONEY>, of course, be expected to evince in some way his sense of it; 'for soul and body,' this poet tells us, 'rive not more in parting than greatness going off.'

In due time she received a reply. _Dear One_, I see you have again ceased minding your own business and I am really very proud of you in spite of your obstinacy. I thought in the wilds of <LOC>, you might get away from responsibilities for awhile, but I might have known that, unless I set you adrift on an iceberg, you would find some lame, or halt, or blind, to succor. Even then, I think the iceberg would melt at your presence, and in short order you would be down among the mermaids explaining to them that it was error to get out on the rocks to do their hair and sing to sailors. Your story is very interesting, and while I believe that <LOC> is as full of <LOC> as it is of beans, Miss <PER> has made it possible to ring every <PER> doorbell and ask down which steps ran the eloping daughter. Rest assured, as her lawyer I shall do my best in this affair. Owing to Mr. <PER>'s prominence in the public prints, his connections are pretty well known, and I thought I associated <PER>, the railroad president, with him. I suppose Miss <PER> would have told you if there were anything in that. The remainder of the letter dealt with different subjects, and, when Mrs. <PER> had finished it, she hastened to her friend, and put her question. ""I will send my father a telegram at once,"" responded the girl. That form of speech was not strictly accurate, as it was rather an elaborate operation to send a telegram from the island.

2438,"On his giving this answer the demeanour of the image of God underwent a remarkable change. From addressing <PER> gruffly, as if he were a malefactor, he began suddenly to speak to him with a sort of eager and feverish amiability as if he were a child. He seemed particularly anxious to coax him away from the balustrade. He led him by the arm towards a door leading into the building itself, soothing him all the time. He gave what even <PER> (slight as was his knowledge of the world) felt to be an improbable account of the sumptuous pleasures and varied advantages awaiting him downstairs. <PER> followed him, however, if only out of politeness, down an apparently interminable spiral of staircase. At <NUM> point a door opened. <PER> stepped through it, and the unaccountable man in buttons leapt after him and pinioned him where he stood. But he only wished to stand; to stand and stare. He had stepped as it were into another infinity, out under the dome of another heaven. But this was a dome of heaven made by man. The gold and green and crimson of its sunset were not in the shapeless clouds but in shapes of cherubim and seraphim, awful human shapes with a passionate plumage. Its stars were not above but far below, like fallen stars still in unbroken constellations; the dome itself was full of darkness. And far below, lower even than the lights, could be seen creeping or motionless, great black masses of men. The tongue of a terrible organ seemed to shake the very air in the whole void; and through it there came up to <PER> the sound of a tongue more terrible; the dreadful everlasting voice of man, calling to his gods from the beginning to the end of the world. <PER> felt almost as if he were a god, and all the voices were hurled at him. “No, the pretty things aren't here,” said the demi-god in buttons, caressingly. “The pretty things are downstairs. You come along with me. There's something that will surprise you downstairs; something you want very much to see.” Evidently the man in buttons did not feel like a god, so <PER> made no attempt to explain his feelings to him, but followed him meekly enough down the trail of the serpentine staircase.

2439,"And when, at the next step, we come to the history of 'the affections,' and are told distinctly that _here_ philosophy, the philosophy of practice, must needs descend from the abstraction, and generalities of the ancient morality, for those observations and experiments which it is the legitimate business of the poet to conduct, though the poet, in conducting these observations and experiments, has hitherto been wanting in the rigor which science requires, when we are told that philosophy must _inevitably_ enter here, that department of learning, of which the true poet is 'the doctor,'--surely here at least, we know where we are. Certainly it is not the fault of the author of <ORG> if we do _not_ know what department of learning the collections of the new learning which he claims to have made will be found in--if found at all, _must_ be found in.

He shows us here, in a few words, under different points and heads, what masterly facilities, what indispensable, incomparable powers it has for that purpose.

'See what learning is!' exclaims the Nurse, speaking at that same date from the same dictation, for there is a Friar 'abroad' there already in the action of that play, who is undertaking to bring his learning to bear upon practice, and opening his cell for scientific consultation and ghostly advice on the questions of the play as they happen to arise; and it is his apparent capacity for smoothing, and reconciling, and versifying, not words only, but facts, which commands the <PER>'s admiration. This doctrine of a practical learning, this part operative of the new learning for which the founders of it beg leave to reintegrate the abused term of Natural Magic, referring to the Persians in particular, to indicate the extent of the field which their magical operations are intended ultimately to occupy; this idea, which the master of this school was illustrating now in the <PER> so happily, did not originate in the <ORG>, as we shall see.

Again, moral philosophy propoundeth to itself the framing of _internal_ goodness, but civil knowledge requireth only an _external_ goodness, for that, as to society, sufficeth.

But heavy as the undertaking must have been, it certainly did not engross all the activities of <PER>’s wife in this period. And it seems highly probable that the <NUM> little mythological dramas which we here publish belong to <DATE>. The evidence for this date is as follows. <PER>’s lyrics, which these dramas include, were published by his wife (_Posthumous Poems_, <DATE>) among the ‘poems written in <DATE>’. Another composition, in blank verse, curiously similar to <PER>’s own work, entitled _<ORG>_, has been allotted by Dr. <PER> (_Relics of <PER>_, <DATE>) to the same category. Again, it may well be more than a coincidence, that the <PER> motive occurs in that passage from <PER>’s _<PER>_, canto <NUM>, on ‘<ORG> gathering flowers’, which <PER> is known to have translated shortly before <PER>’s visit in <DATE>.

Besides, though we all abhorred the monster of Sin itself, yet, from our social superiority, highly rarified education in our lofty top, and large and liberal sweep of the aggregate of things, we were in a good degree free from those useless, personal prejudices, and galling hatreds against conspicuous _sinners_, not _Sin_—which so widely prevail among men of warped understandings and unchristian and uncharitable hearts. No; the superstitions and dogmas concerning <ORG> had not laid their withering maxims upon our hearts. We perceived how that evil was but good disguised, and a knave a saint in his way; how that in other planets, perhaps, what we deem wrong, may there be deemed right; even as some substances, without undergoing any mutations in themselves utterly change their colour, according to the light thrown upon them.

2478,"That there are many less fortunate than themselves is evident from their own constant allusions to that regenerating and elevating missionary work which is among their own functions. They descend apparently and help others to gain that degree of spirituality which fits them for this upper sphere, as a higher student might descend to a lower class in order to bring forward a backward pupil. Such a conception gives point to Christ's remark that there was more joy in heaven over saving <NUM> sinner than over ninety-nine just, for if He had spoken of an earthly sinner he would surely have had to become just in this life and so ceased to be a sinner before he had reached <ORG>. It would apply very exactly, however, to a sinner rescued from a lower sphere and brought to a higher one. When we view sin in the light of modern science, with the tenderness of the modern conscience and with a sense of justice and proportion, it ceases to be that monstrous cloud which darkened the whole vision of the mediaeval theologian. Man has been more harsh with himself than an all-merciful God will ever be. It is true that with all deductions there remains a great residuum which means want of individual effort, conscious weakness of will, and culpable failure of character when the sinner, like <PER>, sees and applauds the higher while he follows the lower. But when, on the other hand, one has made allowances--and can our human allowance be as generous as God's?--for the sins which are the inevitable product of early environment, for the sins which are due to hereditary and inborn taint, and to the sins which are due to clear physical causes, then the total of active sin is greatly reduced. Could one, for example, imagine that <PER>, all-wise and all-merciful, as every creed proclaims, could punish the unfortunate wretch who hatches criminal thoughts behind the slanting brows of a criminal head? A doctor has but to glance at the cranium to predicate the crime. In its worst forms all crime, from <ORG> to <PER>, is the product of absolute lunacy, and those gross national sins to which allusion has been made seem to point to collective national insanity. Surely, then, there is hope that no very terrible inferno is needed to further punish those who have been so afflicted upon earth.

And, indeed, this Poet's manifest philosophical and historical tendencies, and his avowed view of the comprehension of the Poet's business would have seemed beforehand to require some elbow-room,--some chance for poetic curves and sweeps,--some space for the line of beauty to take its course in, which the sharp angularities, the crooked lines, the blunt bringing up everywhere, of the new philosophic tendency to history would scarcely admit of. There was no breathing space for him, unless he could contrive to fix his poetic platform so high, as to be able to override these restrictions without hindrance.

2489,"I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.

She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects. The <NUM> of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles. “When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of <PER>, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own!

I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed. Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity.

All that he said threw greatly into the shade <PER>, <PER>, and <PER>, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.

In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration. Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin.

2508,"I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by <NUM> fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of <PER> or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate.

I visited <LOC> with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being. <PER> did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.

He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.” Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of <LOC> and finish my work in solitude.",unknown,JaneAusten,0.9991439580917358,0.9991439580917358,-0.5684595704078674

2514,"But that is not all. The bettering of _itself_, the perfection of its own form, is, by the constitution of things, a force, a _motive_, an _actual_ 'power in everything that moves.' This is one of the primal, universal, natural motions. It is in the universal creative stamp of things; and strong as that is, the rock on which here, too, the hope of science rests--strong as that is, the pillar of the state, which here, too, it will rear. For to man the highest '_passive_ good,' and this, too, is of the good which is 'private and particular,' is, constitutionally, that whereby 'the conscience of good intentions, however succeeding, is a more continual joy to his nature than all the provision--the most luxurious provision--which can be made for security and repose,--whereby the mere empirical experimenter in good will count it a higher felicity to fail in good and virtuous ends towards the public, than to attain the most envied success limited to his particular. Thus, even in these decried '_private_' motives, which actuate all men--these universal natural instincts, which impel men yet more intensely, by the concentration of the larger sensibility, and the faculty of the nobler nature of their species, to seek their own private good,--even in these forces, which, unenlightened and uncounterbalanced, tend in man to war and social dissolution, or 'monstrous' social combination,--even in these, the scientific eye perceives the basis of new structures, 'constructions according to true definitions,' in which _all_ the ends that nature in man grasps and aspires to, shall be artistically comprehended and attained. But this is only the beginning of the scientific politician's 'hope.' This is but a collateral aid, an incidental assistance. This is the place on his ground-plan for the buttresses of the pile he will rear. There is an unborrowed foundation, there is an internal support for the state in man. For along with that particular and private nature of good, there is another in all men;--there is another motive, which respects and beholds the good of society, not mediately, but directly as _its_ end,--which embraces in its intention 'the form of human nature, whereof we are members and portions, and _not_--not--our own proper, individual form'; and this is the good 'which is in degree the greater and the worthier, because it tends to the conservation and advancement of a more general form.'",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.9872133135795593,0.9872133135795593,-0.4776438772678375

2528,"He will have a comparative anatomy to help him. This analysis will not stop with the social unit, he will analyze him. It will not stop with him.

He will not stop in his analysis of _this_ complexity till he comes to that which precedes all combination, and survives it--the original simplicity of nature. He will come to this cure armed with the universal 'simples;' he will have all the original powers of nature, 'which are not many,' in his hands, to begin with; and he will have more than that. He will have the doctrine of their combinations, not in man only, but _in all the <LOC> despised kinds, that claim such close relationship-- such wondrous relationship with man; and he will not go to the primitive instinctive nature only for his knowledge on this point.

My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart. It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me, “I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but <DATE> an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.” I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued— “I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear <PER> as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years.",unknown,JaneAusten,0.9969764947891235,0.9969764947891235,-2.038408041000366

How would you feel about the matter if we came not to want to fight at all?” “I should feel,” answered the other, “just as I should feel if you had drawn your sword, and I had run away from it.

And besides, they are useful for adorning discourse, and furnish abundance of rhetorical material. Above all, they are invaluable to the scholastic controversialists, and the new philosopher will not undertake to displace them in these fields. He steadfastly refuses to come into any collision with them. He leaves them to take their way without.

When, upon the beef being fished out with a huge pitch-fork, the water for the <TIME>’s tea is poured in; which, consequently possesses a flavour not unlike that of shank-soup. From this it will be seen, that, so far as cooking is concerned, a “_cook of the mess_” has very little to do; merely carrying his provisions to and from the grand democratic cookery. Still, in some things, his office involves many annoyances. Twice a week butter and cheese are served out—so much to each man—and the mess-cook has the sole charge of these delicacies. The great difficulty consists in so catering for the mess, touching these luxuries, as to satisfy all. Some guzzlers are for devouring the butter at a meal, and finishing off with the cheese <DATE>; others contend for saving it up against _Banyan Day_, when there is nothing but beef and bread; and others, again, are for taking a very small bit of butter and cheese, by way of dessert, to each and every meal through <DATE>. All this gives rise to endless disputes, debates, and altercations. Sometimes, with his mess-cloth—a square of painted canvas—set out on deck between the guns, garnished with pots, and pans, and _kids_, you see the mess-cook seated on a matchtub at its head, his trowser legs rolled up and arms bared, presiding over the convivial party. “Now, men, you can’t have any butter to-day. I’m saving it up for to-morrow. You don’t know the value of butter, men. You, <PER>, take your hoof off the cloth! Devil take me, if some of you chaps haven’t no more manners than so many swines!

Those natural peculiarities of disposition that work so incessantly and potently in this human business, those 'points of nature,' those predetermining forces of the human life, must come under observation here, and the whole nature of the passions also, and a science of 'the will,' very different from that philosophy of it which our metaphysicians have entertained us with so long. He will have all the light of science, all the power of the new method brought to bear on this study. And he will have a similar collection, not less scientific, of the history of the human fortunes and their necessary effects on character; for these are the points that we must deal with 'by way of application, and to these all our labour is limited and tied; for we cannot fit a garment except we take a measure of the form we would fit it to.'

He at <NUM> seemed inclined to resist her wishes, but complied, after exchanging, unperceived by <PER>, a glance with the stranger, the meaning of which the latter appeared perfectly to understand. <PER> also attended her. Their walk towards Dr. <PER>'s dwelling was almost a silent one; and the few words that passed between them did not relate to the adventure which occupied the thoughts of each. On arriving at the house, <PER>'s attendants took leave of her, and retired. <PER>, eluding <PER>'s observation with little difficulty, hastened back to the old oak-tree. From the intelligence with which the stranger had received his meaning glance, the young man had supposed that he would here await his return. But the banks of the stream, upward and downward, so far as his eye could reach, were solitary. He could see only his own image in the water, where it swept into a silent depth; and could hear only its ripple, where stones and sunken trees impeded its course.

The angler had apparently set little store by the fruits of his assumed occupation; for the last fish that he had taken lay, yet alive, on the bank, gasping for the element to which <PER> was sufficiently compassionate to restore him. After watching him as he glided down the stream, making feeble efforts to resist its current, the youth turned away, and sauntered slowly towards the college. <PER>, on her return from her walk, found Dr. <PER>'s little parlor unoccupied; that gentleman being deeply engaged in his study, and his lady busied in her domestic affairs.

2649,"And besides, this dogmatical mode of teaching does not appear to him to secure the ends of teaching. He wishes to rouse the human mind to activity, to compel it to think for itself, and put it on the inevitable road to his conclusions. He wishes the reader to strike out those conclusions for himself, and fancy himself the discoverer if he will. So far from being simple and straightforward, his style is in the profoundest degree artistic, for the soul of all our modern art inspired it. He thinks it does no good for scholars to call out to the active world from the platform of their last conclusions. The truths which men receive from those didactic heights remain foreign to them. 'We want medicines to arouse the sense,' says <PER>, who proposed exactly the method of teaching which this philosopher had, as it would seem, already adopted. 'I bring a trumpet to awake his _ear_, to set his _sense_ on the attentive bent, and _then_ to speak,' says that poet who best put this art in practice. But here it is the prose philosopher who would meet this dull, stupid, custom-bound public on its own ground. He would assume all its absurdities and contradictions in his own person, and permit men to despise, and marvel, and laugh at them in him without displeasure. For whoever will notice carefully, will perceive that the use of the personal pronoun here, is not the limited <NUM> of our ordinary speech. Such an one will find that this philosophical _I_ is very broad; that it covers too much to be taken in its literal acceptation. Under this term, the term by which each man names _himself_, the common term of the individual humanity, he finds it convenient to say many things. 'They that will fight _custom_ with _grammar_,' he says, 'are fools. When another tells me, or when I say to myself, _This_ is a word of <ORG> growth; _this_ a dangerous phrase; _this_ is an ignorant discourse; thou art too full of figures; _this_ is a paradoxical saying; _this_ is a foolish expression: _thou makest thyself merry sometimes, and men will think_ thou sayest a thing in good earnest, which thou only speakest in jest. Yes, say I; but I correct the faults of _inadvertence, not those of custom_.

2650,"She said almost sharply and yet with evident sincerity: “Of course I am awfully grateful to you for all you've done--and there's plenty of room if you'll come in.” <PER>, with the complete innocence of an absolutely sound motive, immediately jumped into the car; but the girl cast an eye at <ORG>, who stood in the road for an instant as if rooted like a tree. Then he also tumbled his long legs into the tonneau, having that sense of degradedly diving into heaven which so many have known in so many human houses when they consented to stop to tea or were allowed to stop to supper. The slowly reviving chauffeur was set in the back seat; <PER> and <ORG> had fallen into the middle one; the lady with a steely coolness had taken the driver's seat and all the handles of that headlong machine. A moment afterwards the engine started, with a throb and leap unfamiliar to <PER>, who had only once been in a motor during a general election, and utterly unknown to <ORG>, who in his present mood thought it was the end of the world. Almost at the same instant that the car plucked itself out of the mud and whipped away up the road, the man who had been flung into the ditch rose waveringly to his feet. When he saw the car escaping he ran after it and shouted something which, owing to the increasing distance, could not be heard. It is awful to reflect that, if his remark was valuable, it is quite lost to the world. The car shot on up and down the shining moonlit lanes, and there was no sound in it except the occasional click or catch of its machinery; for through some cause or other no soul inside it could think of a word to say. The lady symbolized her feelings, whatever they were, by urging the machine faster and faster until scattered woodlands went by them in <NUM> black blotch and heavy hills and valleys seemed to ripple under the wheels like mere waves. A little while afterwards this mood seemed to slacken and she fell into a more ordinary pace; but still she did not speak. <PER>, who kept a more common and sensible view of the case than anyone else, made some remark about the moonlight; but something indescribable made him also relapse into silence.

2651,"This part of learning concerneth then 'the regiment and government of every man over himself, and not over others.' '_As_ in architecture _the direction_ of _the framing_ the _posts, beams_, and _other parts_ of _building_, is not the same with the manner of joining them and erecting the building; and in mechanicals, the direction _how_ to _frame_ AN INSTRUMENT OR ENGINE is not the same with the manner of _setting it on work_, and employing it; _and yet, nevertheless_, in expressing of the one, you _incidentally_ express the _aptness_ towards the other _so_ the doctrine of the conjugation of men in society differeth from _that_ of _their conformity <ORG>_.' The received doctrine of that conjugation certainly appeared to; and the more this scientific doctrine of the parts, and the conformity <ORG>, is incidentally expressed,--the more the scientific direction _how to frame_ the instrument or engine, is opened, the more this difference becomes apparent. But even in limiting himself to the individual human nature as it is developed in particular persons, regarding society only as it is incidental to that, even in putting down his new scientific platform of the good that the appetite and will of man naturally seeks, and in marking out scientifically its _degrees_ and _kinds_, he gives us an opportunity to perceive in passing, that he is not altogether without occasion for the use of that particular art, with its peculiar 'organs' and 'methods' and 'illustration,' which he recommends under so many heads in his treatise on that subject, for the delivery or tradition of knowledges, which tend to _innovation_ and _advancement_--knowledge which is 'progressive' and 'foreign from opinions received.' This doctrine of _duty_ is sub-divided into <NUM> parts; the _common_ duty of every man as a MAN, or A MEMBER of A STATE, which is that part of the platform and exemplar of good, he has before reported as 'extant, and well laboured.'

BUT as to this love of glory which the stoics, whom this philosopher quotes so approvingly, have measured at its true worth; as to this love of literary fame, this hankering after an earthly immortality, which he treats so scornfully in the Roman statesman, let us hear him again in another chapter, and see if we can find any thing whereby _his_ nature and designs will more manifestly be laid open to us. 'Of all the foolish dreams in the world,' he says, that which is most universally received, is the solicitude of reputation and glory, which we are fond of to that degree as to abandon riches, peace, life, and health, which are effectual and substantial good, to pursue this vain phantom.

There is not any <NUM> view of which _reason_ does so clearly accuse the vanity, as that; but it is _so deeply rooted in us_, that I doubt whether any <NUM> ever clearly freed himself from it, or no. _After you have said all, and believed all_ that has been said to its prejudice, it creates so intestine an inclination _in opposition to your best arguments_, that you have little power and firmness to resist it; _for_ (_as <ORG> says_) even those who controvert it, would yet that _the books they write_ should appear before the world with _their names in the title page_, and seek to derive glory from seeming to despise it. All other things are communicable and fall into commerce; we lend our goods-- and stake our lives for the necessities and service of our friends; but to communicate one's honour, _and to robe another with one's own glory_, is very rarely seen.

Here, of course, the moral was proper, and obvious enough; or close at hand, and ready to be produced, in case any serious inquiry should be made for it; though the poet might seem, perhaps, to a severely critical mind, disposed to pursue his philosophical inquiry a little too curiously into the awful secrets of majesty, retired within itself, and pondering its own position;--openly searching what <PER> reverently tells us, the <PER> pronounce to be inscrutable, namely, _the hearts_ of _kings_, and audaciously laying bare those private passages, those confessions, and misgivings, and frailties, for which policy and reverence prescribe concealment, and which are supposed in the play, indeed, to be shrouded from the profane and vulgar eye, a circumstance which, of course, was expected to modify the impression.

But unfortunately this is just the kind of scrutiny which nobody has been able to bestow on this work hitherto, on account of those historical obstructions with which, at the time it was written, it was found necessary to guard such discussions, discussions running into such delicate questions in a manner so essentially incomparably free. For, in fact, there is no plainer piece of English extant, when one comes to look at it. All that has been claimed in the Historical part of this work, may be found here without any research, on the mere surface of the dialogue.

Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin.” As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the <NUM> time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale. Chapter 11 “It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.

For here, too, the mystic, unknown, occult powers, the unreported actualities, are working still, in obedience to their orders, which they had not from man, and taking no note of his.

The _real state of the case_' [namely, whether the yielding motion be, as it were, annihilated _by the predominance_, or there be rather a continued, though an invisible effort] '_will perhaps appear_ in the CONCURRENCE of MOTIONS, although it escape our notice in _their conflict_.' So delicately must philosophy needs be conveyed in a certain stage of a certain class of wrestling instances, where _a combination_ of powers hostile to science produces an '_absolute predominance_' of powers, and it is necessary that the yielding motion should at least appear to be 'as it were, annihilated'; though, of course, that need not hinder the invisible effort at all. 'For on account of the rawness and unskilfulness of the hands through which they pass,' there is no difficulty in inserting such intimations as to the latitude of the axioms which these particular instances adduced here, and 'others which might perhaps be added,' are expected to yield. This is an instance of the freedom with which philosophical views on certain subjects are continually addressed in these times, to that immediate audience of the few 'who will perhaps see farther into them than the common reader,' and to those who shall hereafter apply to the philosophy issued under such conditions--the conditions above described, that key of '<ORG>,' which the author of it has taken pains to leave for that purpose. But the question of 'predominance, which makes our present subject,' is not yet sufficiently indicated.

'THE RULES of _such instances_ of _predominance as occur_ should be _collected, such as_ the following'--and the rule which he gives, by way of a specimen of these _rules_, is a very important one for a statesman to have, and it is one which the philosopher has himself '_collected_' from _such_ instances as occurred--'The more _general_ the desired advantage is, the _stronger_ will be _the motive_.

Alas! concurrent streams of time and water carried _me_ down fast, and I came, on <DATE>, to the <LOC> shore of <LOC>, where I stood looking at the bright blue water, the flushed white mountains opposite, and the boats at my feet with their furled <LOC> sails, showing like enormous magnifications of this goose-quill pen that is now in my hand. —The sky became overcast without any notice; a wind very like the March east wind of <LOC>, blew across me; and a voice said, ‘How do you like it?",CharlesDickens,unknown,0.30618157982826233,,-7.246547222137451

What do you say to sharing my office and being my mascot? Special high chair for <PER>, be it well understood.” The little girl eyed him, her head on <NUM> side.

It wouldn't do for you to talk against <ORG> to the patients in the anteroom.” “What is an anteroom?” “The place where my patients wait until I can see them in my office.” <PER> lifted her shoulders and smiled. “I might read them 'Science and Health' while they waited, and then they wouldn't have to go in.” Dr. <PER>'s laugh rang heartily along the leafy street. “Is that your idea of mascoting a poor young physician?” he inquired. <ORG> laughed in sympathy. She didn't quite understand him, but she knew that they were having a very good time. Pretty soon her companion drove in at the gate of an imposing old residence, set back from the street where the trolley ran with an air of withdrawing from the intrusion of these modern tracks. “I thought it wouldn't injure your conscience to wait for me while I made a couple of professional visits, <ORG>, eh?” he asked, as he jumped out and fastened <PER> to the ring in the hand of a bronze boy. “I won't be any longer than I can help, and don't you go to hoodooing me, now, while I'm upstairs.” The doctor returned to the buggy and took the black case, frowning warningly at the child.",unknown,ArthurConanDoyle,0.9939143061637878,0.9939143061637878,-0.5398665070533752

Mr. <PER> urged the visitor to stay to dinner, but he declined and once more shook hands. “Good-by, <PER>,” he said to the child. “<DATE>, you know.” “Yes indeed, I know,” she returned, an irresistible tendency to hop moving her feet. On nearer acquaintance she had found Mr. <PER> exhilarating. “Good-by, <PER>,” said <PER>. He looked into the face on which rested a cloud. “I think you might be a degree more attentive,” he suggested. “How?” “Oh--take me to the gate, for instance.” <PER> smiled and went with him. He turned with a slight bow that included the group, and they strolled down the path. “It's all up, <ORG>,” remarked Mr. <PER>, <NUM> smiling. “No use wriggling, no use staying away from the mother.

So she contented herself by glaring toward the gate, where could be seen <NUM> figures in earnest conversation. “I had counted so much on Mrs. <PER>'s influence,” <PER> was saying. “What does mother mean?

All the <NUM>-masters, and several of the forecastle-men, were swarming round the double-wheel on the quarter-deck.

2720,"As to the methods by which the early Christians communicated with the spirits, or with the ""Saints"" as they called their dead brethren, we have, so far as I know, no record, though the words of <PER>: ""Brothers, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God,"" show very clearly that spirit communion was a familiar idea, and also that they were plagued, as we are, by the intrusion of unwelcome spiritual elements in their intercourse. Some have conjectured that the ""Angel of the Church,"" who is alluded to in terms which suggest that he was a human being, was really a medium sanctified to the use of that particular congregation. As we have early indications of bishops, deacons and other officials, it is difficult to say what else the ""angel"" could have been. This, however, must remain a pure speculation.

This He would do for <NUM> reasons. The <NUM> is that a psychic circle is a great source of strength to one who is himself psychic, as is shown continually in our own experience, where, with a sympathetic and helpful surrounding, an atmosphere is created where all the powers are drawn out.

2721,"Great things this <PER> promises to man from these observations and interpretations, which he and his company are ordering; great things he promises from the application of this new method of learning to _this_ department of man's want; because those vague popular notions--those spontaneous but deep-rooted beliefs in man--those confused, perplexed terms, with which he seeks to articulate them, and not those acts which make up his life only--are out of nature, and all resolvable into higher terms, and require to be returned into _these_ before man can work with them to purpose. Great _news_ for man he brings; the powers which are working in the human life, and _not_ those which are working without it only, are working in obedience _to laws_. Great things he promises, because the facts of human life are determined by forces which admit of scientific definition, and are capable of being reduced to axioms. Great things he promises, for these distinctive phenomena of human life, to their most artificial complication, are all out of the universal nature, and struggling already of themselves instinctively towards the scientific solution, already 'anticipating' science, and invoking her, and waiting and watching for her coming. Good news the scientific reporter, in his turn, brings in also; good news for the state, good news for man; confirmations of reports indited beforehand; confirmations, from the universal scriptures, of the revelation of the divine in the human. Good news, because that law of the greater whole, which is the worthier--that law of the common-weal, which is the human law--that law which in man is reason and conscience, is in the nature of things, and not in man only--nay, _not_ in man as yet, but prefigured only--his ideal; his true form--not in man, who 'IS' not, but '_becoming_.' But in tracking these universal laws of being, this constitution of things in general into the human constitution--in tracing these universal definitions into the specific terms of human life--the clearing up of the spontaneous notions and beliefs which the mind of man shut up to itself yields--the criticism on the terms which pre-occupy this ground is of course inevitable, whether expressed or not, and is indeed no unimportant part of the result.

2722,"And this method of the delivery and tradition of knowledge which transfers _the root_ with them, that they may grow in the mind of the learner, is the method which this philosopher professes to find wanting, and the one which he seems disposed to invent. He has made a very thorough survey of the stores of the ancients, and is not unacquainted with the more recent history of learning; he knows exactly what kinds of methods have been made use of by the learned in <DATE>, for the purpose of putting themselves into some tolerable and possible relations with the physical majority; he knows what devices they have always been compelled to resort to, for the purpose of establishing some more or less effective communication between themselves and that world to which they instinctively seek to transfer their doctrine. But this method, which he suggests here as the essential condition of the growth and advancement of learning, he does _not_ find invented. He refers to a method which he calls the enigmatical, which has an affinity with it, 'used in some cases by the discretion of the ancients,' but disgraced since, 'by the impostures of persons, who have made it as a _false light_ for their counterfeit merchandises.' The purpose of this latter style is, as he defines it, 'to remove the _secrets_ of knowledge from the penetration of the more vulgar capacities, and to reserve them to _selected auditors_, or to wits of such sharpness as can pierce the veil.' And that is a method, he tells us, which philosophy can by no means dispense with in his time, and 'whoever would let in new light upon the human understanding must still have recourse to it.' But the method of delivery and tradition in those ancient schools, appears to have been too much of the dictatorial kind to suit this proposer of advancement; its tendency was to arrest knowledge instead of promoting its growth. He is not pleased with the ambition of those old masters, and thinks they aimed too much at a personal impression, and that they sometimes undertook to impose their own particular and often very partial grasp of those universal doctrines and principles, which are and must be true for all men, in too dogmatical and magisterial a manner, without making sufficient allowance for the growth of the mind of the world, the difference of races, etc.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.980350911617279,0.980350911617279,-0.6574527025222778

2760,"I was delighted when I <NUM> discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again. “The moon had disappeared from <TIME>, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing. “<DATE>, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire. When <TIME> came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep. “It was morning when I awoke, and my <NUM> care was to visit the fire. I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.976639449596405,0.976639449596405,-1.579440951347351
2761,"So strange were the lights and the silence that the busy hum of voices which usually filled the dining-room at meal times had distinct gaps in it, and during these silences the clatter of the knives upon plates became audible. The <NUM> roll of thunder and the <NUM> heavy drop striking the pane caused a little stir. “It’s coming!” was said simultaneously in many different languages. There was then a profound silence, as if the thunder had withdrawn into itself. People had just begun to eat again, when a gust of cold air came through the open windows, lifting tablecloths and skirts, a light flashed, and was instantly followed by a clap of thunder right over the hotel. The rain swished with it, and immediately there were all those sounds of windows being shut and doors slamming violently which accompany a storm. The room grew suddenly several degrees darker, for the wind seemed to be driving waves of darkness across the earth. No one attempted to eat for a time, but sat looking out at the garden, with their forks in the air. The flashes now came frequently, lighting up faces as if they were going to be photographed, surprising them in tense and unnatural expressions. The clap followed close and violently upon them. Several women <NUM> rose from their chairs and then sat down again, but dinner was continued uneasily with eyes upon the garden. The bushes outside were ruffled and whitened, and the wind pressed upon them so that they seemed to stoop to the ground. The waiters had to press dishes upon the diners’ notice; and the diners had to draw the attention of waiters, for they were all absorbed in looking at the storm. As the thunder showed no signs of withdrawing, but seemed massed right overhead, while the lightning aimed straight at the garden every time, an uneasy gloom replaced the <NUM> excitement. Finishing the meal very quickly, people congregated in the hall, where they felt more secure than in any other place because they could retreat far from the windows, and although they heard the thunder, they could not see anything. A little boy was carried away sobbing in the arms of his mother. While the storm continued, no one seemed inclined to sit down, but they collected in little groups under the central skylight, where they stood in a yellow atmosphere, looking upwards. Now and again their faces became white, as the lightning flashed, and finally a terrific crash came, making the panes of the skylight lift at the joints. “Ah!” several voices exclaimed at the same moment. “Something struck,” said a man’s voice.

2762,"As the doctor did not ask the question, he grew slightly uneasy, and risked the question: “I hope you will accept my assurance that the thing was an accident and that no intrusion was meant.” “Oh, yes, sir,” replied the doctor, smiling, “I accept everything that you say.” “In that case,” said <PER>, rising genially, “we must not further interrupt your important duties. I suppose there will be someone to let us out?” “No,” said the doctor, still smiling steadily and pleasantly, “there will be no one to let you out.” “Can we let ourselves out, then?” asked <PER>, in some surprise. “Why, of course not,” said the beaming scientist; “think how dangerous that would be in a place like this.” “Then, how the devil are we to get out?” cried <PER>, losing his manners for the <NUM> time. “It is a question of time, of receptivity, and treatment,” said the doctor, arching his eyebrows indifferently. “I do not regard either of your cases as incurable.” And with that the man of the world was struck dumb, and, as in all intolerable moments, the word was with the unworldly. MacIan took <NUM> stride to the table, leant across it, and said: “We can't stop here, we're not mad people!” “We don't use the crude phrase,” said the doctor, smiling at his patent-leather boots. “But you _can't_ think us mad,” thundered <ORG>. “You never saw us before. You know nothing about us. You haven't even examined us.” The doctor threw back his head and beard. “Oh, yes,” he said, “very thoroughly.” “But you can't shut a man up on your mere impressions without documents or certificates or anything?” The doctor got languidly to his feet. “Quite so,” he said. “You certainly ought to see the documents.” He went across to the curious mock book-shelves and took down <NUM> of the flat mahogany cases. This he opened with a curious key at his watch-chain, and laying back a flap revealed a quire of foolscap covered with close but quite clear writing. The <NUM> <NUM> words were in such large copy-book hand that they caught the eye even at a distance.

2763,"Finally, changing her wrapper for her nightdress, she climbed into bed, where she lay thinking and looking at the sunlight on the wall. At dinner time the maid <PER> appeared with a tray. “Here's your dinner, Miss Julia,” she said, looking at the heavy-eyed little girl. “It's too bad you're not well.” “I am well, thank you,” replied <PER>. “I'm sorry you had to carry that heavy tray up so many stairs.” “Oh, I don't mind that,” returned the girl good-naturedly. “I'll set it right here by the bed.” “Is grandpa down there?” asked <PER> wistfully. “Yes, Miss Julia. They're all eating their dinner. I hope you'll enjoy yours.” <PER> went away, and the little girl spread some bread and butter and ate it slowly. Meanwhile, when the family had gathered at the dinner table, Mr. <PER> looked up at his housekeeper. “Where is <PER>?” he asked shortly. “I object to her being unpunctual.” “Yes, sir. She is having dinner in her room. She was very naughty and got wet in the brook.” “Ah, indeed!” Mr. <PER> frowned and looked down. He had been a little disappointed that the bright face was not watching to see him come home from his ride, but of course discipline must be maintained. “I'm sorry to hear this,” he added. Mrs. <PER> and <PER> found him a shade less taciturn than usual to-night. He felt vaguely that he now had an ally of his own flesh and blood in the house, a spirit sufficiently kindred to prefer his society to theirs, and this made him unusually lenient. He meant to go upstairs after dinner, and warn <PER> to be more careful in future to conform to all Mrs. <PER>'s rules; but the meal was scarcely over when a friend called to get him to attend some business meeting held that evening in the interests of the town, and he became interested in his statements and went away with him. “Wasn't father quite agreeable <TIME>?” asked Mrs. <PER> of <PER>. “What did I tell you? I could see that he felt relief because that plain little creature was not in evidence. Father always was so fastidious. Of course it is selfish in a way, but it is no use to blame men for caring for beauty.

2765,"There was not a soul or a stir of life within sight. And he had a quite meaningless sensation, as if there never really had been any one else there except he since the foundation of the world. Stiffening in himself the masculine but mirthless courage of the atheist, he drew a little nearer to the wall and, catching the man at a slightly different angle of the evening light, could see his face and figure quite plain. <NUM> facts about him stood out in the picked colours of some piratical schoolboy's story. The <NUM> was that his lean brown body was bare to the belt of his loose white trousers; the other that through hygiene, affectation, or whatever other cause, he had a scarlet handkerchief tied tightly but somewhat aslant across his brow. After these <NUM> facts had become emphatic, others appeared sufficiently important. <NUM> was that under the scarlet rag the hair was plentiful, but white as with the last snows of mortality. Another was that under the mop of white and senile hair the face was strong, handsome, and smiling, with a well-cut profile and a long cloven chin. The length of this lower part of the face and the strange cleft in it (which gave the man, in quite another sense from the common one, a double chin) faintly spoilt the claim of the face to absolute regularity, but it greatly assisted it in wearing the expression of <NUM>-smiling and <NUM>-sneering arrogance with which it was staring at all the stones, all the flowers, but especially at the solitary man. “What do you want?” shouted <PER>. “I want you, <PER>,” said the eccentric man on the wall, and with the very word he had let himself down with a leap on to the centre of the lawn, where he bounded once literally like an <LOC>-rubber ball and then stood grinning with his legs astride. The <NUM> facts that <PER> could now add to his inventory were that the man had an ugly-looking knife swinging at his trousers belt, that his brown feet were as bare as his bronzed trunk and arms, and that his eyes had a singular bleak brilliancy which was of no particular colour. “Excuse my not being in <TIME> dress,” said the newcomer with an urbane smile.",Chesterton,ArthurConanDoyle,0.986328661441803,0.986328661441803,-2.6113271713256836

For what makes heaven different from earth! Look how my courtiers come! Magnificent! None shall dare wait on me but those who bear An empire on their backs in sheets of gold. Oh, what a slave I was! my <ORG>, My vineyards & my corn were all my wealth And men esteemed me rich; but now <ORG> Transcends me but by lightning, and who knows If my gold win not the Cyclopean Powers, And <ORG>, who must hate his father’s rule, To forge me bolts?—and then—but hush! they come. <ORG> & Lacon. LACON. Pardon us, <PER>— MIDAS. What would ye, slaves? Oh! I could buy you all with <NUM> slight touch Of my gold-making hand! <PER>. <PER>, We humbly would petition for relief. <ORG>. Relief I Bring me your copper coin, your brass, Or what ye will—ye’ll speedily be rich. ZOPYRION. ’<PER> not for gold, but to be rid of gold, That we intrude upon your Majesty. I fear that you will suffer by this gift, As we do now. Look at our backs bent down With the huge weight of the great cloaks of gold. Permit us to put on our shabby dress, Our poor despised garments of light wool:— We walk as porters underneath a load. Pity, great king, our human weaknesses, Nor force us to expire— <ORG>. <ORG>, ye slaves! Go clothe your wretched limbs in ragged skins! Take an old carpet to wrap round your legs, A broad leaf for your feet—ye shall not wear That dress—those golden sandals—monarch like. <PER>.",unknown,EdgarAllanPoe,0.7706220149993896,0.7706220149993896,-4.888050079345703
